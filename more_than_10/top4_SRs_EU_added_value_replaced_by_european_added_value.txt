EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 
2006 to show EU solidarity towards workers affected by mass redundancies. 
The EGF should facilitate the re-integration into employment of those workers 
by providing financial contributions for time-limited and coordinated packages 
of personalised services. Such packages include active labour market 
measures such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and 
outplacement. They also often include income support and other allowances 
paid to workers.
II.	The European Social Fund (ESF) also supports redundant workers, mainly 
through lifelong learning programmes. However, whereas the purpose of the 
ESF is to address long-term structural imbalances, the EGF was designed to 
address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
III.	Until 31 December 2012, EGF aid packages represented 627 million euro 
for 89 approved member states applications. The EGF co-finances measures 
at a rate of 50 % or 65 %, with the balance being provided by the Member 
State concerned.
IV.	The Court concluded that:
(a)	Nearly all EGF eligible workers were offered personalised and well-
coordinated measures.
(b)	Each EGF measure may also be eligible for the ESF and some Member 
States preferred to use the ESF rather than EGF.
(c)	 No quantitative re-integration objectives were set. Moreover, existing data 
are not adequate to assess the effectiveness of the measures in re-
integrating workers into employment.
(d)	The EGF delivered European added value when used to co-finance services for 
redundant workers or allowances not ordinarily existing under Member 
States’ unemployment benefit systems.
(e)	However, in all the audited cases, the Court identified measures to provide 
workers with income support, which would have been paid by the Member 
States anyway. Sixteen of the 19 Member States that benefited from the 
EGF included income support measures in their packages. Globally, 
income support measures represented 33 % of the costs refunded for all 
EGF cases.
(f)	The EGF approval procedure, requiring the need for an ad hoc budgetary 
procedure, is very long. This hampers EU solidarity with the redundant 
workers targeted. 
V.	The Court recommends that:
(a)	The Member States and the Commission take the necessary steps to 
ensure the availability of up-to-date and reliable data in order to monitor the 
achievement of objectives, as well as to compare the outcome of the 
various measures.
(b)	The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission consider 
limiting EU funding to measures likely to provide European added value, rather 
than funding already existing national workers’ income support schemes.
(c)	The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission consider, as 
an alternative to the current EGF scheme, the possibility of adapting the 
ESF framework and its funding allocations in order to support more rapidly 
workers affected by mass redundancies.
INTRODUCTION
1.	The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 
2006 to show EU solidarity towards workers affected by mass redundancies. 
The EGF should facilitate the re-integration into employment of those workers 
by providing financial contributions for time-limited and coordinated packages 
of personalised services . Such packages include active labour market 
measures such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and 
outplacement. They also often include income support and other allowances 
paid to workers. 
2.	The EGF is outside the Multi-annual Financial Framework. As a result each 
application for EGF support submitted by a Member State has to pass a 
thorough assessment by the Commission and obtain approval from the EU 
budgetary authority (Council and European Parliament). The Commission 
shares the management of the EGF with the Member States.
3.	Redundant workers can also benefit from the European Social Fund, mainly 
through lifelong learning programmes. However, whereas the purpose of the 
ESF is to address long-term structural imbalances, the EGF was designed to 
address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
4.	The EGF supports workers made redundant as a result of major structural 
changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation (500 dismissals or more  in 
one or more enterprises in the EU) where those redundancies have a 
significant adverse impact on the regional or local economy (the “trade 
criterion”). In this respect, applicant Member States must demonstrate that the 
redundancies are linked to a substantial increase of imports into the EU, the 
rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to 
third countries.
5.	By way of derogation, from 1 May 2009 to 31 December 2011, the EGF was 
also applicable to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global 
financial and economic crisis (the “crisis criterion”) . 
6.	For instance, when the effects of the crisis devastated the Danish 
shipbuilding industry, there were redundancies as a consequence. In that 
Member State, the EGF supported redundant workers of the last Danish 
shipyard (see Picture 1). Another example is the German automotive supply 
industry, which was particularly hit in the regions of Lower Saxony and North 
Rhine-Westphalia (see Picture 2).

7.	From 9 March 2007 (date of the first application) to 31 December 2012, total 
EGF aid approved amounted to 627 million euro (379 million euro from the EU 
budget and 247 million euro from the Member States) for 89 approved 
applications  from a maximum yearly budgetary ceiling of 500 million euro 
during the 2007-2013 period. The EGF co-finances measures at a rate of 50 % 
or 65 % , with the difference coming from the Member State concerned. 
8.	The EGF is currently scheduled to run until 31 December 2013. The 
Commission has however proposed to continue with a new EGF Regulation 
until 31 December 2020 .
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
9.	The overall objective of the audit was to assess the contribution made by 
the EGF, in the form of European added value, to enabling redundant workers to 
return to the labour market as soon as possible. The Court examined in 
particular the following questions:
(a)	Did all affected workers benefit from personalised EGF measures, and 
were EGF co-financed active labour market measures coordinated with 
other similar measures (i.e. ESF and Member State measures)?
(b)	Was the EGF effective in terms of labour market re-integration? 
(c)	Is the nature of the EGF measures likely to deliver European added value?
(d)	Was the EGF approval procedure implemented in a timely manner?
10.	Eight cases in four Member States (two each in Denmark, Germany, Ireland 
and Lithuania) in which the EGF was deployed, were audited on the spot. 
They amounted to 67 million euro out of 627 million euro (10,7 %) of EGF aid 
committed until 31 December 2012. The sample of eight cases only comprised 
implemented cases and reflected the different sizes of EU economies, the 
diversity of the economic sectors affected and important differences between 
the EGF intervention criteria (see Table 1).

11.	The audit covered the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012. 
The audit was carried out through interviews, the examination of documents 
held by the Commission and the four audited Member States authorities, and 
an analysis of the data on re-integration rates.The audit in the Member States 
also included the organisation of eight focus group meetings at which the 
various local EGF stakeholders (academics, administrations and social 
partners) could share their views (see Picture 3).

12.	In addition to the above, the results of the Commission’s mid-term 
evaluation of the EGF were analysed . The mid-term evaluation report of 
December 2011 covered the first 15 cases  co-financed by the EGF in eight 
Member States. One of these (Nokia, Germany) was included in the sample 
audited on-the-spot by the Court.
13.	Finally, the Court carried out a survey by addressing questionnaires to 
Member States (Bulgaria, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, 
Slovakia and the United Kingdom) in order to identify the reasons why they did 
not use the EGF.
OBSERVATIONS
Nearly all workers were offered personalised and well-coordinated 
measures 
14.	In order to demonstrate solidarity to all affected workers personalised 
measures should be offered not only to the workers made redundant in the 
main enterprise affected, but also to those employed by suppliers of that 
enterprise. 
15.	In the audited cases nearly all affected workers could benefit from EGF 
measures. No instances of the intentional exclusion of potential beneficiaries 
were identified.
16.	However in the cases of Karmann and Dell, the Court found that an 
unknown number of redundant workers formerly employed by the affected 
enterprises’ suppliers were not included in any EGF support measure .The 
main reasons for non-inclusion lay in the difficulties faced by Member States in 
assessing which suppliers were affected. 
Services were personalised
17.	Services offered to the potential beneficiaries were generally tailored to their 
needs and therefore most likely to get results. This positive aspect already 
reported by the mid-term evaluation was confirmed by the Court’s assessment 
of the eight EGF cases audited. Concrete examples of personalised services 
are provided in Box 1.
?
Box 1 - Three cases of packages of personalised services in Ireland and 
Denmark
In the case of Dell, the Irish authorities provided child care support and distance 
learning services. County and City Enterprise Boards delivered special courses for 
redundant Dell workers (“Start Your Own Business”), as well as mentoring to cope with 
administrative procedures. 
In the case of SR Technics, some courses, such as aeronautics courses with the Irish 
Aviation Authority, had been specifically designed. Where relevant courses could not 
be provided specifically for redundant workers, grants were released to allow them to 
take part in appropriate courses delivered to a larger population (80 % were technical 
courses or aviation industry-related). For the first time ever in Ireland, the Training and 
Employment Authority worked together with the Department of Defence and the 
Department of Education and Skills to set up apprenticeships for civilians.
In Denmark (Odense Steel Shipyard (I)), the EGF facilitated the implementation of 
high quality training measures. These measures were of a more long-term and 
personalised nature and leading to qualifications superior to those which were 
normally offered to unemployed persons, and the possibility of sectoral reconversion. 
According to several participants in the focus group organised by the auditors, the 
personalised services went well beyond the scope of national personalised measures 
and were perceived as a unique opportunity, as they gave redundant workers 
ownership of their personal re-integration project.
18.	In Ireland, the applications did not always establish the link between 
personalised services and actual labour market needs. As a result, at this 
stage, it was not identified whether the measures put forward were best suited 
to support the re-integration of the redundant workers.
EGF measures were generally well-coordinated with national measures 
and the ESF
19.	In order to maximise theeffects of EGF measures, the EGF Regulation 
states that they should always take the form of a coordinated package of 
personalised services. What is meant is coordination with measures preceding 
or concomitant to the personalised services co-financed by the EGF . Member 
States should also coordinate their interventions with the Structural Funds , in 
particular the ESF.
20.	The Court observed that, generally, the Member States effectively 
coordinated the EGF with ESF and national labour market measures. Existing 
ESF measures were usually complemented by additional EGF measures 
specifically designed to address workers’ needs. 
21.	Moreover, for the eight audited cases, the Court did not detect instances of 
overlap between the different measures, or double-funding of individuals. 
Some Member States preferred the ESF over the EGF
22.	Although the ESF is not expected to address unforeseeable events, all 
measures under the EGF Regulation may equally be applied under the ESF . 
Whether or not the ESF may co-finance support for workers subject to a mass 
redundancy caused by an unforeseeable event, essentially depends on the 
national eligibility rules and the content of operational programmes. 
23.	The Court’s survey of Member States having never used the EGF 
intervention concluded on the following reasons for preferring the ESF over the 
EGF:
(a)	The higher co-financing rate for the ESF (up to 85 %) than for the EGF (up 
to 65 %) is a disincentive to apply for the latter. This was stated by six 
Member States  and had already been recognised by the Commission in 
2010 .
(b)	The ESF can be implemented more swiftly than the EGF, or national 
administrations are more familiar with the ESF .
(c)	The lack of EGF pre-financing . 
(d)	The length of the procedure for approving EGF applications .
24.	The more restrictive EGF conditions, in particular the trade criterion, are 
another reason why the ESF is preferred over the EGF. After a mass 
redundancy, some Member States may find it easier to redirect ESF funding 
towards support for redundant workers rather than apply for EGF funding. For 
instance, the British authorities never requested EGF assistance in spite of 
having identified 18 cases that might have qualified for such support .
Re-integration into employment of EGF supported workers cannot be 
reliably assessed
25.	In order to assess the performance of a fund it is necessary to monitor and 
evaluate its results and impacts and to compare them to other schemes having 
similar objectives. Taking into account its objective the EGF’s most relevant 
performance indicator is its capacity to reintegrate  redundant workers. 
26.	The Court verified that the re-integration rates calculated as a percentage of 
the re-integrated workers out of the affected workers were available for all eight 
audited cases. Table 2 shows these percentages for different standard cut-off 
periods.

27.	Whilst re-integration data at the end of the EGF measures was available for 
all employers except the case of SR Technics, data were often not available 
(“NA”) for the other cut-off periods shown in Table 2. In the case of Odense 
Steel Shipyard (I), due to the timing of the EGF measures , there were no data 
available about the situation of affected workers after one year. A complete 
overview was possible only for Lithuania. The table shows that the EGF made 
a certain contribution to the re-integration of redundant workers. 
28.	In the most successful example (“Construction” case, Lithuania), 59 % of all 
the redundant workers were re-integrated at the end of the EGF measures. The 
lowest rate of re-integration at that stage was 21 % of workers immediately re-
integrated after the end of the EGF assistance (Dell case, Ireland). Taking the 
situation 12 months after the end of the EGF measures, the highest re-
integration rate reported was 68 % (Karmann case, Germany); however, in only 
four of the eight cases were any data available at that stage. 
Lack of re-integration objectives and specific EGF performance data 
29.	A multiplicity of factors adversely affected the quality and availability of re-
integration data. Firstly, the Member States generally did not set quantitative 
re-integration objectives. Out of the eight cases audited only one   included 
such an element. As a result, it is not possible to assess the measures’ 
effectiveness in terms of achieving their objectives.
30.	Secondly, in Germany, Denmark and Ireland, the public or private 
employment services, when collecting re-integration data, did not 
systematically differentiate between the EGF, the ESF and other national 
measures specifically designed for workers affected by mass redundancies. 
31.	For instance, in Germany, the combination of several ESF and EGF-funded 
training modules made it difficult to isolate the impact of individual measures, or 
groups of measures, on re-integration . External factors (overall economic 
situation, involvement of Volkswagen in the case of Karmann, employment 
subsidies) also had an important impact on re-integration.
32.	Thirdly, Member State authorities audited generally did not distinguish 
between the two main kinds of EGF measures: 
(a)	active labour market measures such as training, aid for self-employment, 
coaching and outplacement;
(b)	income support paid to workers.
33.	Whilst this significant distinction was absent in Germany, Denmark and 
Ireland, the Lithuanian managing authority went so far as to provide re-
integration data that distinguished between the workers participating in each of 
the various measures.
34.	In addition, there is no specific information, allowing the identification of the 
ESF co-financed projects that could actually have met the EGF intervention 
criteria. This identification would have been useful in order to make 
comparisons between the re-integration rates achieved by funds with different 
budgetary, legal and operational arrangements. In turn, this would have 
contributed towards measuring the impact of EGF. The insufficient quality 
(inaccuracy, incompleteness and inconsistency) of ESF monitoring information 
available has already been highlighted in previous performance audits by the 
Court. In particular, the Commission does not have consistent and reliable 
performance data on EU supported targets, and its assessment and 
supervision are currently not oriented towards performance .
Re-integration data were difficult to compare
35.	Comparing re-integration data is a difficult exercice under any 
circumstances. As stated in the EGF mid-term evaluation both supply-side (the 
qualifications of redundant workers) and demand-side factors (local economic 
and labour market conditions) influenced the re-integration results . 
36.	However, in the context of the EGF an additional element hampered this 
comparison. This refers to the differences between the timing of the EGF and 
that of other labour market actions, as those workers in greater need of help 
were left to the EGF, which is relatively slower to implement (see Box 2 and 
paragraph 42). 
37.	In particular, given that the ESF and EGF both support the training and re-
integration of the unemployed, such a comparison is necessary with respect to 
sound financial management as it could highlight potential structural problems. 
The example below (Box 2) illustrates this.
Box 2 - Nokia’s transfer companies – unequal performance owing to differences 
in timing
The mobile phone company Nokia closed its Bochum (North-Rhine-Westphalia) site 
on 30 June 2008. Three transfer companies (as they are called under German law) 
were successively set up to accommodate temporarily redundant workers.
The first transfer company (exclusively supported by ESF funding), was set up in June 
2008, seven months before Germany even applied for the EGF. That company yielded 
a re-integration rate of 66 %. The third and last transfer company was only set up 
when EGF funding was applied for, in February 2009; it achieved a re-integration rate 
of 4,35 %.
The Nokia case speaks volumes – not because ESF funding performed so much 
better than the EGF, but because the ESF proved quicker to mobilise than the EGF 
and thus delivered better re-integration results. Indeed, the EGF alone had to cater for 
persons with more difficult cases and who could not be successfully re-integrated by 
the previous transfer companies.
38.	The above example shows that timeliness is one of the most important 
criteria when a fund including re-integration objectives aims at some degree of 
success. The Nokia case also shows that the EGF and ESF both supported the 
same target group, but for reasons diametrically opposed to the purpose for 
which each fund was designed. The ESF, a structural fund, alleviated an 
emergency; the EGF, an emergency fund, supported those whom it was more 
difficult to reintegrate. 
39.	In fact the EGF and ESF intervene as complementary funds which provide 
either long-term strategic help, or act as a one-off time-limited and specific 
response to a single restructuring emergency.
Germany
40.	The managing authority did not consider a comparison between different 
sets of re-integration data to be feasible. As a result, it neither identified a 
comparable statistical population group for the group of EGF beneficiaries, nor 
made a comparison with overall re-integration rates at Federal level.
Denmark
41.	Due to missing data, no comparison was possible between the re-
integration results of EGF project participants and general re-integration rates 
outside the audited cases. 
Ireland
42.	Surveys conducted by the managing authority concluded that, within the 
same time frame, the employment rate for redundant workers who did not 
benefit from the EGF was higher than the employment rate for EGF 
beneficiaries. The difference in employment rates can be partially explained by 
the fact that some persons did not finalise training or education pathways.
43.	Nonetheless, according to the managing authority, a probable cause of the 
EGF’s lower re-integration rate in Ireland would be differences between the 
profiles of redundant workers, the most skilled workers finding a job without 
EGF help.
Lithuania
44.	EGF re-integration results varied significantly from one EGF project to 
another, depending on the measures implemented and the target group 
addressed, which made a straightforward comparison impossible.
The Commission
45.	Monitoring information was only available to the Commission in the form of 
the EGF final reports, six months after the end of the implementation period. 
However, as a result of the inconsistency and unreliability of the re-integration 
data (see paragraphs 25 to 44), these reports prevent any reasonable 
comparison between different EGF cases, or between the measures applied in 
each case.
46.	In particular, the final reports do not provide an in-depth analysis of the 
nature and the percentage of allowances paid or committed for all the  EGF 
cases approved so far. Furthermore, the Commission’s database did not allow 
the identification and fund allocation of the individual EGF measures nor 
performance indicators like participation figures or re-integration rates. Also, no 
information is provided on the individual ESF or national measures having 
preceded or complemented the EGF ones.
One third of EGF funding compensates national workers’ income support 
schemes, with no European added value
47.	The European added value goes beyond the concept of simple added value. It can 
be defined as the value that an EU action adds to the value that would 
otherwise have been created by Member States acting alone. In particular, 
expenditure from the EU budget must offer clear and visible benefits for the EU 
and its citizens which, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, 
are better achieved at Union level . 
48.	The Court refers in particular to the OECD definition of active labour market 
programmes.  Accordingly, measures aiming at the improvement of the 
beneficiaries’ prospect of finding gainful employment or otherwise increasing 
their earnings’ capacity are qualified as active and therefore are considered to 
meet the conditions for an European added value. These measures  include not only 
services such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and outplacement, 
but also mobility allowances and educational grants, as well as allowances 
granted in the context of the EGF and not ordinarily existing under the Member 
State’s unemployment benefit system. 
49.	By contrast, workers’ income support measures, consisting of 
unemployment benefits and programmes for early retirement, cannot be 
considered as delivering European added value. Indeed, workers’ income support 
does not represent an ‘active’ labour market measure  and moreover this 
reduces the share of these measures in the EGF package. In the mid-term 
evaluation, the Commission had already reported that on average only 26 % of 
EGF spending consisted of training measures .
50.	As can be seen in Table 3 below, a common pattern among the eight 
audited cases is that they included EGF measures to provide income support, 
which would have been paid by the Member States anyway, irrespective of 
EGF intervention. The impact of this type of EGF intervention is to compensate 
part of the cost of the Member States’ unemployment benefit system, and there 
is no added value in such an intervention other than EU additional funding for 
the Member States.
Workers’ income support measures represent the majority of the co-
funded expenditure for half of the cases audited
51.	For each of the cases of the audited sample the Court calculated the 
amounts of EGF funding committed to the different types of measures and in 
particular to workers’ income support (see Table 3). 
Table 3 - Breakdown of EGF funding by type of personalised measures in 
the eight EGF cases audited

 

Source: ECA, based on available data from DG Employment, Social Affairs and 
Inclusion and Member State authorities.
52.	In six of the eight cases shown in Table 3, the EGF packages included a 
relatively high proportion of income support. Indeed, in Germany and Denmark, 
one case in Ireland and one in Lithuania, more than a third of the total value of 
the respective packages of personalised measures was composed of income 
support. 
53.	In the particular cases audited in Germany and Denmark, training measures 
meant to re-skill or up-skill redundant workers represented only a third or less 
of the respective EGF packages. On the other side, income support measures 
in the form of unemployment benefits or the equivalent represented 50 % to 
73 %. In those cases, moreover, the link between a redundant worker’s income 
support and his/her effective participation in an EGF funded labour market 
measure such as training could not systematically be established.
Globally, workers’ income support measures account for one third of re-
funded costs
54.	In the absence of a satisfactory EGF database of cases, the Court 
examined the Member State application data collected by the Commission for 
each of the 89 EGF cases for which information was available and relevant. It 
was found (see Table 4) that 33 % of EGF support for workers (thus excluding 
technical assistance to Member States) was composed of income support 
measures such as unemployment benefits.

55.	Six Member States have been allocated 29 % of the total EGF co-financing 
and 89 % of all the income support measures approved to date. As well as 
Germany and Denmark, the six included Austria, Italy, France and Malta . 
56.	The Court also notes that the Commission’s proposal for the next 
Multiannual Financial Framework seeks to limit EGF support in the form of 
allowances, which include workers’ income support, to a maximum of 50 % of 
any EGF package . 
Different EGF co-funding in similar economic circumstances
57.	The Court notes inconsistent outcomes in similar economic circumstances 
with respect to workers’ income support measures in the case of Germany as 
compared to Austria , which are the two most intensive users of this kind of 
EGF support.
58.	O Germany considered for EGF funding purposes that the duration of the 
training or qualification measures  represent slightly less than half of workers’ 
normal working time . By contrast, Austria considered that similar measures 
represented 100 % of the normal working time. This is due to the fact that the 
Austrian short-term allowance scheme provides for a definition of full-time 
occupation to be as low as 50 % of the normal working time.
59.	 As a consequence of these different national decisions, EGF co-funding of 
short-term allowance represented proportionally the double in Austrian cases 
when compared to German cases. The Court notes however that this 
difference in the EGF funding decision did not affect ultimately the individuals 
as they received in full the allowances foreseen in the national schemes.
The EGF approval procedure is too long for an emergency fund
60.	In order to maximise its impact the EGF should be able to provide its 
financial contribution rapidly in order to allow the affected workers to benefit of 
the funded measures as soon as possible after having been made redundant.
61.	After having established the average length of the approval procedure, the 
Court assessed to what extent it can be made shorter taking into account the 
different legal provisions and rules to be respected.
62.	The EGF approval procedure is the process from the moment a Member 
State officially applies until the Commission and the Budgetary Authority 
commit the financial contribution to an EGF case. It can be divided into 
consecutive stages (called later assessment procedure, budgetary procedure 
and empowerment procedure), which last together on average 41 weeks.
Graph - Schematised view of the EGF approval procedure
 
The assessment procedure could be shortened
63.	The assessment procedure is composed of the appraisal procedure and the 
Commission’s internal consultation procedures leading to the adoption of the 
proposal for a decision by the budgetary authority. It takes on average 
30 weeks. 
64.	The appraisal procedure takes on average 15 weeks when taking as a 
starting point the date of the official application of the Member State, but it is 
much longer when taking into account informal exchange of information 
between the responsible Member State authority and the Commission.
65.	One of the factors contributing to the length of the appraisal procedure is 
the possibility foreseen in the EGF Regulation to supplement Member State 
applications any time after they officially applied. Introducing a time limit to this 
possibility as well as taking stock of learning curve benefits may reduce the 
length of 15 weeks necessary to appraise applications of Member States who 
are in emergency situations. The subsequent internal consultations within the 
Commission also take 15 weeks on average.
The budgetary and empowerment procedures have a further impact on 
timeliness
66.	As the EGF operates outside of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, 
each EGF case is subject to a specific budgetary procedure in order to make 
available the related appropriations. In practice, this means that once the 
Commission has identified sufficient margins and/or cancelled commitments, 
the decision to deploy them has to be taken by the budgetary authority . This 
budgetary procedure requires an additional and incompressible period of 
approximately seven weeks. 
67.	Then the empowerment procedure completes the approval procedure, 
leading to the adoption of the formal decision to pay a financial contribution. Its 
length, an average of 4 weeks, is closely linked to the provisions of the 
Commission’s rules of procedure . Finally, once agreed, the financial 
contribution is paid to the Member State concerned.
The EGF approval procedure is not timely
68.	To conclude, the approval procedure is very long, especially considering 
that the EGF is supposed to be an emergency fund. In the mid-term evaluation 
report, evaluators already pointed out to the Commission in 2011 that the long 
EGF approval procedure could be considered too slow to offer a genuinely 
‘rapid response’ mechanism in times of crisis.
69.	The length of the entire approval procedure is of an average of 11 weeks 
longer than for an ordinary financing decision of the Commission.
In the end, the budgetary authority approved all the projects submitted by 
the Commission 
70.	The budgetary authority has approved all proposals submitted by the 
Commission. Only one out of 114 applications has ever been rejected. This is 
likely due to the Commission’s very effective support for Member States during 
the application stage. Indeed, in all of the eight audited cases the Court found 
sufficient evidence of effective support for the Member States. 
71.	Furthermore, not one audited or surveyed Member State authority 
expressed dissatisfaction with respect to the Commission service responsible 
for the EGF, but pointed instead to issues concerning the EGF procedure as a 
whole rather than the quality of support.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
72.	The Court is aware of the need for showing EU solidarity towards workers 
affected by redundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns. 
However, the Court is not convinced that all the features of the current EGF 
mechanism are the most appropriate to deliver specific support with EU added 
value to redundant workers.
Nearly all eligible workers were offered personalised and well-
coordinated measures
73.	Nearly all eligible workers could benefit from personalised EGF measures. 
However, in some cases redundant workers formerly employed by the 
suppliers of an affected enterprise were not included in EGF support 
(paragraphs 14 to 18).
74.	In general, EGF support was well coordinated with ESF and national labour 
market measures, in that existing measures were complemented by additional 
EGF measures specifically designed to address workers’ needs (paragraphs 19 
to 21).
75.	Whereas the ESF is intended to address long-term structural imbalances, 
the EGF was designed to address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
Although the ESF is not expected to address unforeseeable events, all 
measures under the EGF Regulation may equally be applied under the ESF. 
Some Member States have preferred to deploy the ESF rather than the EGF 
owing to the higher co-financing rate, quicker implementation and the 
availability of pre-financing, as well as the lengthy approval procedure and 
more restrictive conditions under EGF (paragraphs 22 to 24).
Re-integration into employment of EGF supported workers cannot be 
reliably assessed
76.	Re-integration data exist but are not sufficiently accurate, consistent or 
detailed for any conclusions to be drawn. As a result, no useful comparisons or 
benchmarking could be made between EGF measures within an EGF case, 
EGF cases between one another or EGF cases against other active labour 
market programmes. No quantitative re-integration objectives were set 
(paragraphs 25 to 46).
Recommendation 1
In order to improve the quality of the information on the achievements of the different 
cases and on the effectiveness of measures supporting redundant workers, the 
Member States and the Commission should take the necessary steps to ensure the 
availability of up-to-date and reliable data in order to monitor the achievement of 
objectives, as well as to compare the outcome of the various measures.
One third of EGF funding compensates national workers’ income support 
schemes, with no European added value
77.	When used to co-finance services for redundant workers or allowances not 
ordinarily existing under Member State unemployment benefit systems, the 
EGF delivered European added value. This refers in particular to active measures 
aiming at the improvement of the beneficiaries’ prospect of finding gainful 
employment or otherwise increasing their earnings’ capacity such as training, 
aid for self-employment, coaching and outplacement, mobility allowances and 
educational grants (paragraphs 47 to 49).
78.	However, in all the audited cases the Court identified measures to provide 
workers with income support, which would have been paid by the Member 
States anyway. Consequently, the Court considers that only training and direct 
active support measures for redundant workers have an European added value other 
than additional funding for the Member States. Sixteen of the 19 Member 
States which benefited from the EGF included income support measures in 
their packages. Income support measures represented 33 % of the costs 
refunded for all EGF cases (paragraphs 50 to 56).
79.	The Commission did not sufficiently monitor the weight of workers’ support 
measures (paragraphs 45 to 46). In addition, different Member State decisions 
may result in different EGF co-funding for similar  income support measures 
(paragraphs 57 to 59).
Recommendation 2
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should consider limiting 
EU funding to measures likely to provide European added value, rather than funding already 
existing national workers’ income support schemes.
The EGF approval procedure is too long for an emergency fund
80.	The EGF approval procedure is very long. This has a deterrent effect as 
regards the use of the EGF and consequently hampers EU solidarity with the 
redundant workers targeted. 
81.	In addition, the need for a budgetary procedure  adds to the overall length of 
approval (paragraphs 60 to 69).
Recommendation 3
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should consider, as an 
alternative to the EGF scheme, the possibility of adapting the ESF framework in order 
to support more rapidly workers affected by mass redundancies.

Additionality
The EU SME guarantee facility is intended to provide 
additional access to finance for SMEs and not to 
substitute for state spending. Additionality will 
typically occur if lending volumes increase when 
compared to a scenario without EU intervention.
CIP
The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework 
Programme was established by Council Decision No 
1639/2006 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council covering the period 2007-2013. It is a 
programme launched by DG ENTR and DG ECFIN, 
managed by the EIF under the supervision of DG 
ECFIN to foster entrepreneurship and innovation of 
EU SMEs.

EIF
The European Investment Fund has been set up by 
the EIB to structure and grant specialised financial 
products, including venture capital, guarantee 
instruments for SMEs and securitisation. The EIF 
works with a network of financial intermediaries, many 
of which are specialised in SME finance. In the 
context of the CIP, the EIF can be seen as the 
operational manager of the SME Guarantee facility.
EIP
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is 
one of 3 pillars of the CIP framework to promote 
entrepreneurship and innovation.

Financial instruments
In the text this refers to the SMEG facility. Other 
Community financial instruments for SMEs under the 
EIP Programme include the High Growth and 
Innovative SME Facility (GIF) and the Capacity 
Building Scheme (CBS).
Financial intermediary
The financial intermediaries participating in the SMEG 
facility can be public guarantee institutions, mutual 
guarantee organisations, micro-finance institutions or 
commercial banks. They may be direct lenders that 
provide loans to SMEs, or indirect guarantee 
organisations that either co-guarantee or counter-
guarantee a loan portfolio, of one or several direct 
lenders.

G&E
The Growth and Employment initiative established by 
Council Decision 347/1998 covering the period 1998-
2000. The successor programme of G&E is the MAP.
Guarantee cap amount
The guarantee cap amount refers to the maximum 
amount of losses for which the EIF is liable under an 
EU guarantee.
Guarantee cap rate
The guarantee cap rate is a pre-agreed rate at which 
the EIFâ€™s liability is capped under a guarantee 
agreement. The amount of the EIFâ€™s liability under a 
guarantee agreement (guarantee cap amount) can be 
calculated by multiplying the actual portfolio volume 
by the guarantee rate and the guarantee cap rate. 
E.g. portfolio volume = 1000; guarantee rate = 50 %; 
guarantee cap rate = 10 %. Thus, maximum EIF 
liability (guarantee cap amount) = 1000 x 50 % x 
10 % = 50.
Guarantee deal
Guarantee deals are the individual guarantee 
agreements between the EIF and a financial 
intermediary covering the activities performed on the 
basis of these agreements.
Impact
Longer-term socio-economic consequences that can 
be observed after the completion of an intervention, 
which may affect either direct or indirect addressees 
of the intervention. 
Implementation report
The CIP Council Decision stipulates that the 
Commission should draw up an annual 
implementation report for the Framework Programme 
and for each specific programme, examining the 
supported activities in terms of financial 
implementation, results and, where possible, impact. 
The Commission should communicate the annual 
implementation reports to the European Parliament, 
the Council, the European Economic and Social 
Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
Input


Financial, human and material resources that are 
mobilised for the implementation of an intervention. 
Lisbon Strategy
During the meeting of the European Council in Lisbon 
(March 2000), the Heads of State or Government 
launched a "Lisbon Strategy" aimed at making the 
European Union the most competitive economy in the 
world and achieving full employment by 2010.
MAP
The Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise and 
Entrepreneurship covering the period 2001-2006 is an 
SME programme of DG ENTR managed by the EIF 
under the supervision of DG ECFIN. It was the 
predecessor programme of the CIP.
Maximum portfolio 
amount 
The maximum portfolio amount is the maximum loan 
volume which may be covered by the EU guarantee. 
It is established by the EIF for each financial 
intermediary, taking into account various 
considerations such as the available EU budget and 
comparable past lending volumes. 
OECD

Development
Outcome
Change that arises from the implementation of an 
intervention and which normally relates to the 
objectives of this intervention. Outcomes include 
results and impacts. Outcomes may be expected or 
unexpected, positive or negative. 
Output
What is produced or accomplished with the resources 
allocated to an intervention. 
Reference volume
Reference volume represents the amount of 
guarantees or financing which the intermediary could 
reasonably be expected to achieve in the absence of 
the EU guarantee.
Result
Immediate changes that arise for direct addressees at 
the end of their participation in an intervention. 
SME
Small and Medium-sized Enterprise. As per 
Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 
concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-
sized enterprises, SMEs are defined as enterprises 
which employ fewer than 250 employees, which have 
an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, 
and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 
43 million euro and conform to the criterion of being 
an autonomous enterprise.
SMEG facility




SME Guarantee facility: a financial instrument 
managed by the EIF, providing guarantees or counter 
guarantees to financial intermediaries for loans 
granted by financial institutions to SMEs aiming at 
increasing the SMEsâ€™ debt financing supply.
SMEG windows
The four windows of the SMEG facility are:
*	debt financing via loans or leasing,
*	microcredit financing,
*	guarantees for equity or quasi-equity 
investments in SMEs, and
*	securitisation of SME debt finance portfolios.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I. The SME Guarantee (SMEG) facility is a financial instrument managed by 
the 
European Investment Fund on behalf of the European Commission and 
providing 
guarantees or counter guarantees to financial intermediaries for loans 
granted by 
financial institutions to SMEs aimed at increasing the supply of debt 
financing.

II. The objective of the Courtâ€™s audit was to assess the effectiveness of 
the SMEG 
facility, notably the design and planning, the management of its 
operations and 
the achievement of its objectives. 

III. The Court found that the objectives of the current SMEG facility are 
more 
precise than under the predecessor programmes, but they are only 
specific, 
measurable, achievable and timed in relation to the expected outputs. The 
intervention logic was not made explicit and limited quantification of 
potential 
impacts was provided at the planning stage of the facility. 

IV. The framework for the management of daily operations is considered 
appropriate, but does not include scoring standards or minimum 
requirements for 
the selection of financial intermediaries. 

V. Sufficient output indicators were established, which were used to 
report on 
SMEGâ€™s implementation. Reporting requirements are satisfactory and 
accepted 
by the financial intermediaries. 

VI. The only quantified target relating to the number of SMEs to be 
reached with 
the SMEG facility is attainable. Concerning the purpose of the loans 
granted, less 
than half were given to SMEs that lacked collateral and only 12 % were 
given to 
SMEs that used them for innovative investments. The analysis of the 
Courtâ€™s 
sample of loans identified a deadweight of 38 %. The European added value of 
the 
facility was not clearly demonstrated before it was launched neither is 
it indicated 
in the guarantee agreements with the financial intermediaries. 

VII. The Court recommends that the programme logic should be made 
explicit in 
any similar future intervention, and additional or better performance 
indicators 
considered. The selection of potential financial intermediaries should be 
based on 
minimum requirements for the criteria that have to be fulfilled by the 
applicants 
and a scoring system should be put in place to make the applications 
comparable. 
Appropriate measures to minimise deadweight should be envisaged. During 
the 
planning period, the European added value of the instrument should be clearly 
demonstrated. 


INTRODUCTION
SMEs and access to finance
1.	Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU 
economy , representing 99 % of all enterprises and providing 75 million 
jobs in the 
European Union .  However, the financial markets are wary of investing in 
new or 
young SMEs which are perceived as high-risk investments, especially if 
they are 
in innovative markets. According to the Observatory of European SMEs , 
limited 
access to finance is a problem for SMEs in Europe. The public sector has 
an 
important role to play in supporting the SME sector, in particular the 
provision of 
suitable financing. 
2.	SME policy is a key element of the Lisbon Strategy aiming to make 
Europe a 
more attractive place to invest and work . The Lisbon Strategy stressed 
that 
entrepreneurial initiatives and innovation must be stimulated and 
encouraged. 
Therefore a friendly environment should be created for starting up 
innovative 
businesses, especially SMEs . One of the EU support measures to SMEs 
facilitates their access to external finance and is known as the SME 
Guarantee 
(SMEG) facility. 
3.	The SMEG facility was established in October 2006 as part of the 
Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)  . It originates 
in 
Council Decision 98/347/EC on measures of financial assistance for 
innovative 
and job-creating SMEs â€“ Growth and Employment (G&E), which was continued 
as part of the subsequent Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise and 
Entrepreneurship (MAP)  established in 2001. Under the CIP, the SMEG 
facility is 
one of the Communityâ€™s financial instruments which were launched under 
the 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP) (see Annex I). 
4.	The EIP has wide ranging objectives: â€œto improve access to finance 
for the 
start-up and growth of SMEs and investment in innovation activitiesâ€. The 
SMEG 
facility encompasses different types of guarantee schemes, each aiming to 
support entrepreneurship through the enhancement of SME access to 
finance. It 
comprises four different schemes (or â€˜windowsâ€™), the loans and leases 
window, 
the micro credit window, the equity and quasi-equity window and the 
securitisation 
window.
5.	The SMEG facility was allocated 978 million euro for the period 1998 
to 2013 
under the three successive framework programmes (G&E, MAP and CIP). At 
the 
end of 2009 this budget guaranteed a total loan portfolio of 10,6 billion 
euro (see

The main features of the SMEG facility
7.	The operational management of the SMEG facility involves several 
parties 
(see Figure 1).
Figure 1 - Overview of the SMEG process flow
 
Source: European Court of Auditors.
8.	Two Directorates General at the European Commission, plus the 
European 
Investment Fund (EIF) , are all involved in the design, management and 
monitoring of the SMEG facility. The Directorate General for Enterprise 
and 
Industry (DG ENTR) is the coordinator of the legal basis, prepares the 
annual 
work programmes and implementation reports of the various CIP pillars and 
is 
responsible for organising the programme evaluations. The Directorate 
General 
for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) has the direct management 
responsibilities for SMEG, being in charge of negotiating the Fiduciary 
and 
Management Agreement (FMA) with the EIF , approving financial 
intermediaries, 
monitoring cash movements on the trust accounts and ensuring that funds 
are 
spent in line with the CIPâ€™s objectives.  
9.	The EIF provides guarantees to financial intermediaries aiming to 
improve 
their lending capacity and, therefore, the availability and terms of 
loans towards 
SMEs. The EIF signs guarantee agreements in its own name, on behalf of 
the 
Commission and at the risk and cost of the Union budget. In order to 
allow the 
Commission to monitor the facility, the EIF reports to DG ECFIN on the 
progress 
achieved on a quarterly basis.
10.	The financial intermediaries participating in the SMEG facility are 
public 
guarantee institutions, mutual guarantee organisations, micro-finance 
institutions 
and commercial or publicly owned or controlled banks. They can be direct 
lenders 
that provide loans to SMEs or indirect guarantee organisations that 
either co-
guarantee or counter-guarantee  a SME loan portfolio of one or several 
direct 
lenders. Each guarantee deal  determines specific target volumes for the 
loans to 
be achieved by the financial intermediary. 
11.	SMEs have to meet the Commissionâ€™s SME definition to be eligible for 
a 
guarantee under the SMEG facility. An SME is defined as an enterprise 
which 
employs fewer than 250 employees and which has an annual turnover not 
exceeding 50 million euro and/or an annual balance sheet total not 
exceeding 
43 million euro. It must also satisfy the criterion of being an 
autonomous 
enterprise .
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
12.	The objective of the Courtâ€™s audit was to assess the effectiveness of 
the 
SMEG facility by addressing the following audit questions:
-	Has the Commission designed the SMEG facility and its management 
structure in a coherent and effective manner?
-	Have the Commission and the EIF established and applied effective 
procedures to select appropriate financial intermediaries and to monitor 
the 
performance of the SMEG facility?
-	Have the SME guarantee deals contributed to the achievement of the 
policyâ€™s objectives? 
13.	The audit examined the roles and responsibilities of all main parties 
involved in 
the SMEG facility â€“ the Commission, the EIF and the financial 
intermediaries. The 
main focus was the SMEG facility under the CIP (2007-2013); the SMEG 
under 
the MAP was used for the purpose of comparisons with the CIP. 
14.	The audit covered the following:
-	an assessment of whether the SMEG objectives were SMART and whether 
the design and planning of the facility was likely to achieve effective 
results;
-	an evaluation of the management of the SMEG facilityâ€™s operations, 
comprising an assessment of the financial intermediary selection 
procedures and the Commission and EIF reporting and monitoring 
procedures;
-	visits to nine financial intermediaries  (out of the 14 that were 
contracted at 
the audit planning stage in June 2009). They were selected according to 
the following criteria: (i) type of guarantee, (ii) actual guarantee 
volume 
achieved, (iii) type of financial intermediary, and iv) direct guarantee 
or 
counter-guarantee. For each financial intermediary the related guarantee 
proposal, its assessment by the EIF and the Commission and the 
agreement signed between the EIF and the financial intermediary were 
examined;
-	selection of a sample of 181 loans from the nine financial 
intermediaries 
visited in order to assess that the use of the guaranteed SME loans was 
in 
line with the SMEG objectives ; and
-	a questionnaire to all 51 financial intermediaries participating 
under MAP 
and/or CIP  in order to obtain their views on the design and management 
of the SMEG facility . 
AUDIT FINDINGS
Design of the SMEG facility
15.	Public intervention is more likely to be successful if it is properly 
designed. In 
order to assess the design, this section analyses the intervention logic 
underlying 
the SMEG facility. It scrutinises the ex-ante impact assessment for the 
CIP  
related to the SMEG facility and the extent to which the results of this 
assessment 
were taken into account during the design stage. Finally, the objectives 
of the 
SMEG facility are assessed in the light of specific, measurable, 
achievable, 
relevant and timed (SMART) criteria.
The SMEG facility is based on a valid implicit intervention logic
16.	The intervention logic provides the link between an intervention's 
inputs and 
the production of its outputs and, subsequently, to its impacts on 
society in terms 
of results and outcomes. It describes how an intervention is expected to 
attain its 
global objectives. An explicit intervention logic shows how the programme 
is 
supposed to function.
17.	Neither the CIP Decision nor the Commissionâ€™s proposal or the impact 
assessment for CIP explicitly described the intervention logic of the 
SMEG facility 
in this manner. The absence of an explicit intervention logic was also 
noted by the 
EIP interim evaluator . 
18.	The different preparatory documents, however, do provide sufficient 
information to make an implicit assumption on how the SMEG facility is 
supposed 
to function. For lenders it can be difficult to assess individual loan 
applications and 
the risks involved, especially if a borrower does not have an established 
track 
record (start-ups). In such a situation the borrowers can guarantee the 
loan to the 
lender through the provision of collateral, but those who do not have 
sufficient 
collateral may be denied access to credit even with viable business 
propositions. 
The SMEG facility seeks to remedy this situation by providing guarantees 
in cases 
where the SMEs are unable to do so. 
19.	Nevertheless, in the absence of an explicit intervention logic, it is 
difficult to 
understand the rationale of some specific elements of the SMEG facility, 
such as 
targeting innovative SMEs by the loan window. Innovative SMEs are 
targeted 
through debt financing although equity investments are generally 
considered more 
appropriate for this type of SME .
The impact assessment helped to design the facility; however, it 
contained 
little factual evidence in support of the facility
20.	The impact assessment is an important instrument used by the 
Commission 
when designing a policy . The impact assessment should identify and 
analyse 
the problem at stake,  the objectives to be pursued and the main policy 
options 
that are available to achieve those objectives. For the various policy 
options, the 
assessment should evaluate their likely economic, social and 
environmental 
impacts. Finally, the impact assessment should identify the monitoring 
and 
evaluation arrangements needed during policy implementation.
21.	As regards the SMEG facility, this type of analysis forms part of the 
CIP impact 
assessment. The CIP impact assessment contained all the mandatory 
sections 
and as such it gives insight into the considerations that shaped the 
design of the 
CIP and its main elements such as the SMEG facility. Thus, the CIP impact 
assessment represents an improvement compared to the MAP, for which no 
such 
analysis was made. 
22.	However, many parts of the CIP impact assessment are not sufficiently 
detailed and quantified. For example, the analysis of the problem lacks 
any 
indication of its magnitude and the analysis of different policy options 
is based 
only on a simplistic qualitative comparison without any quantification of 
the likely 
impacts. For the retained option, except for the impact on the number of 
jobs, the 
Commission quantified expected outputs  instead of the impact. 
Compared to MAP, the objectives are more precise, but still lack clarity 
and 
specific targets 
23.	SMART objectives shall be set for any budget activity . The 
objectives are 
considered:
-	specific if they are precise and concrete enough not to be open to 
varying 
interpretations ; 
-	measurable if the output can be measured and therefore any 
improvements 
assessed; 
-	achievable if the expected results can realistically be produced with 
the 
available resources;
-	relevant if they relate to the needs and to the strategic objectives; 
and
-	timed if they relate to a deadline or time period24.
24.	Due to the rather complex structure of the CIP (see Annex I), the 
hierarchical 
structure of the objectives is also complex. Four global objectives are 
set at the 
level of the framework programme . In the case of the EIP which includes 
the 
SMEG facility, the immediate objectives  are defined at the level of the 
specific 
programme . Although no specific objectives are set at the level of the 
financial 
instruments, article 19.2 of the CIP Decision describes each window of 
the SMEG 
facility in an objective-like fashion (see Box 1).
Box 1-  Objectives relevant to the SMEG facility
Global objective
To foster the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular of SMEs.
Immediate objective 
To improve (â€¦) access to finance for the start-up and growth of SMEs and 
investment in innovation activities.
The four SMEG windows 
Loan window - shall reduce the particular difficulties SMEs face in 
accessing 
finance either due to the perceived higher risk associated with 
investments in 
certain knowledge-related activities such as technological development, 
innovation and technology transfer, or due to a lack of sufficient 
collateral.
Microcredit window - shall encourage financial institutions to play a 
greater role in 
the provision of loans of a smaller amount which would normally involve 
proportionately higher unit handling costs for borrowers with 
insufficient collateral. 
In addition to guarantees or counter-guarantees, financial intermediaries 
may 
receive grants to partially offset the high administrative costs inherent 
in micro 
credit financing.
Equity and quasi equity window - shall include investments which provide 
seed 
capital and/or capital in the start-up phase, as well as mezzanine 
financing, in 
order to reduce the particular difficulties which SMEs face because of 
their weak 
financial structure, and those arising from business transfers.
Securitisation window - shall mobilise additional debt financing for SMEs 
under 
appropriate risk-sharing arrangements with the targeted institutions. 
Support for 
those transactions shall be made available upon an undertaking by the 
originating 
institutions to grant a significant part of the liquidity resulting from 
the mobilised 
capital for new SME lending in a reasonable period of time.
25.	The objectives are relevant, but they are only specific, stated in a 
measurable 
format and timed as regards the expected outputs of the facility. The 
quantified 
target of reaching 315 750 SMEs seems to be reasonably achievable (see 
paragraph 77). 
26.	Compared to the MAP, the objectives of the SMEG facility were more 
precise. 
However, they are defined in a very broad manner. For instance, according 
to the 
EIP immediate objective, the loans have â€œto improve access to finance for 
the 
start-up and growth of SMEsâ€. Such an objective implies a very broad set 
of 
potential target SMEs as it can be argued that almost any borrowing by 
any SME 
will be undertaken in order to ensure the growth of a company. Also, the 
concept 
of innovation has been interpreted in a wide way .
27.	The CIP impact assessment sets an output target for the number of 
SMEs 
expected to benefit within the seven year programme horizon. Targets in 
terms of 
results or impact have not been set (for more details, see paragraph 64). 
An 
estimated number of direct jobs maintained or created within five years 
was 
provided in the impact assessment. This does not directly relate to any 
of the 
objectives, but can be derived from the renewed Lisbon strategy.
Setting up the management structure of the SMEG facility: delegating the 
day-to-day management to the EIF 
28.	The cornerstone of efficient and effective delegation is the 
contractual 
agreement detailing the provisions for the implementation of the tasks 
entrusted to 
the specialised body. This contractual agreement should in particular 
detail the 
obligations of the specialised body and include all appropriate 
arrangements for 
ensuring that the policy objectives will be attained . 
29.	The EIF has systematically developed expertise in providing financial 
engineering products to SMEs in Europe. It was selected by the European 
Community to operate the day-to-day management of the SMEG facility at 
its start 
in 1998. Using the EIF under the successive multi-annual programmes (G&E, 
MAP and then CIP) aims to ensure the required continuity of the 
management of 
the SMEG facility. 
30.	In this context, the Court examined: 
-	whether the implementation of the SMEG facility was being effectively 
planned to avoid delays and to provide an uninterrupted support to the 
SMEs; 
and
-	whether the regulatory framework  defining the services to be 
provided by 
the EIF ensures efficient and effective management of the facility.
Delays in planning the SMEG facility
31.	Considering that the MAP covered the period from 2001 to 2006 and the 
CIP 
covers the period from 2007 to 2013, the start of the operations under 
the CIP 
should have been planned in order to preserve the continuity of the 
financial 
support. The FMA should have been in place at least 11 months (see 
paragraph 
33) before the start of the CIP as this would have left sufficient time 
for signing the 
guarantee agreements between the EIF and the financial intermediaries.
32.	The first draft version of the FMA under the CIP was dated March 
2006, but 
was not signed until 20 September 2007, nearly nine months after the 
start of the 
CIP. Thereafter, it took almost one year until the first guarantee 
agreement 
between the EIF and a financial intermediary was signed  (see Figure 2).
Figure 2 - Timeline of the MAP and CIP legal base
 
33.	The average period from the receipt of the CIP application from an 
intermediary up to the signature of the agreement was nearly eleven 
months . 
Moreover, the timeframe for the application process was considered to be 
unreasonable by eight out of 21 respondents to the Courtâ€™s questionnaire 
. This 
delay in the selection process was mainly caused by the need to resolve 
technical 
issues raised by the EIF before the implementation of the SMEG facility, 
such as 
agreeing on a definition of and measuring the additionality of the loan 
guarantees 
(see paragraph 84). Altogether, this led to a significant time gap in the 
transition of 
the successive programmes.
To preserve the continuity of the support a â€œretroactivity clauseâ€ was 
introduced
34.	The continuity of the support is important for the financial 
intermediaries as 
some introduced specific loan products tailored to the needs of the SMEG 
facility. 
The interruption of EU support could cause higher losses to the financial 
intermediaries if the product was maintained without the EU guarantee.  
35.	The â€œretroactivity clauseâ€ was introduced with the aim of minimising 
the time 
gap between the two successive programmes and preserving continuity 
between 
the MAP and CIP programmes. This clause enabled the financial 
intermediaries to 
retroactively include loans to be supported by the facility which they 
had entered 
into between the end of the availability period under MAP and the date on 
which 
their CIP guarantee agreement was signed. 
36.	As a result, the equal treatment of financial intermediaries was not 
ensured 
since the financial intermediaries which had participated in the MAP 
benefited 
from favourable treatment through the retroactive inclusion of loans. 
Loans could 
be retroactively included as from September 2007, whereas new financial 
intermediaries could only include loans once their guarantee agreement 
with the 
EIF  had been signed.
37.	Although the retroactivity clause was designed to resolve the 
financial 
intermediariesâ€™ funding gap between MAP and CIP, it could not always 
prevent a 
disruption of EU support to SMEs. This was the case for two of the nine 
financial 
intermediaries visited for which the availability period under MAP ended 
before 
the start of the CIP availability period (a gap of four months). 
Appropriate management framework established to operate the SMEG 
facility 
38.	The SMEG facility operates under the joint management of the 
Commission 
and the EIF . To ensure a successful delegation, the FMA and the related 
operational guidelines should include:
-	a definition of the action to be implemented, such as the specific 
objectives 
per window (see Box 1 for a description of the windows);
-	the management structure for the implementation of the tasks; and
-	the setting up of an adequate fee structure for the services provided 
by the 
EIF.
39.	Article 3 of the FMA stipulates the tasks the EIF has to implement 
(see Box 2): 
Box 2 â€“ EIF main tasks for managing the SMEG facility:
- Identification, evaluation and selection of financial intermediaries;
- Determination of, and agreement with, the financial intermediaries on 
the nature 
and detailed conditions of the EU guarantees; 
- Decisions to commit funds; and
- Execution, management and termination of the EU guarantees (including 
reporting and monitoring).
40.	For each SMEG window, operational guidelines  were developed 
detailing the 
specific purpose, the selection of the intermediaries, the eligibility 
criteria, the EU 
guarantee and the modus operandi. The Commission issued Guidance on 
Enhanced Access to Finance on 29 October 2007 to supplement these 
operational guidelines, in particular the provisions of the FMA on 
establishing the 
parameters of the guarantee agreement. 
41.	The management structure established for the SMEG facility was 
appropriate 
as it improved the operational guidelines and the other provisions for 
the 
implementation of the tasks compared with those under the MAP, since they 
cover all tasks to be carried out in sufficient detail.  
42.	The fees to be paid to the EIF should be calculated so as to take 
into account:
-	performance in achieving specific targets;
-	the geographical distribution in the eligible countries; and
-	the degree of novelty and complexity of the guarantee instrument.
43.	The EIF fee scheme has been improved under CIP compared to MAP since:
-	the fee structure has been split into four distinctive components 
better 
reflecting the associated workload for each task; and 
-	the fee entitlement is triggered by the achievement of specific 
results (see  
Table 3).

remuneration

Source: Annex 13 of the Fiduciary and Management Agreement.
44.	The EIF â€œsignature feeâ€ gives a specific bonus for wide geographic 
coverage of 
intermediaries. Furthermore, fees are paid for the participation of 
intermediaries in 
countries that were not covered before and also for new intermediaries 
who did 
not participate under the previous programmes. 
45.	Despite the incentive fee for using specific windows, the equity and 
quasi-
equity guarantees and securitisation windows had not been utilised as at 
31 
December 2009. This is partly due to the financial crisis which 
negatively 
impacted the securitisation market as a whole.
Selection of financial intermediaries
46.	The audit assessed the selection process in respect of the following:
-	whether the framework guiding the EIF on the selection of financial 
intermediaries was complete and ensured fair and transparent selection; 
-	whether the agreement parameters, determining the extent of the EUâ€™s 
intervention, had been correctly set; and
-	whether policy objectives had been correctly translated into the 
guarantee 
agreements.
Well designed selection framework
47.	The appraisal process should apply common standards to evaluating 
financial 
intermediaries, so as to ensure fair, structured and transparent 
selection. The EIF 
and the Commission should create and apply minimum standards for the 
selection 
of potential intermediaries. 
48.	The Commission empowered the EIF  to select intermediaries by 
applying 
the selection criteria and process set out in the relevant guarantee 
policies . The 
guarantee policies further state that the intermediaries are to be 
selected in 
conformity with best practice. An overview of the SMEG selection process 
carried 
out by the EIF is provided in Box 3.
Box 3 â€“ the EIFâ€™s selection process for intermediaries
*	Analysis of intermediariesâ€™ applications following an open call 
procedure
*	Pre-selection of the applications â€“ standardised check on formal 
requirements
*	Due diligence process (including setting of guarantee parameters)
*	Independent opinion of the EIFâ€™s Risk Management Department
*	Assessment by the EIFâ€™s Compliance Department
*	Approval by the EIF Board of Directors and by the European Commission 
(Director ECFIN â€“ L)
49.	When defining the facilityâ€™s management framework, the following 
criteria for 
selecting potential financial intermediaries were laid down in the FMA :
-	financial standing and operational capability of the intermediary and 
its ability 
to manage risk and to comply with the terms and conditions of the SMEG 
facility;
-	whether the intermediary guarantees debt and/or micro-credit 
financing 
provided by a wide range of lenders to SMEs;
-	geographic coverage (loan window only);
-	possibility of providing mentoring and business support (micro credit 
window 
only); and
-	acceptance of the â€œEnhanced Access to Financeâ€ criterion (see 
paragraph 
54).
50.	The Court considers the criteria for the selection of financial 
intermediaries to 
be in line with practices in comparable financial institutions. However, 
neither the 
Commission nor the EIF set scoring standards against which the 
intermediariesâ€™ 
applications could have been assessed, rated and compared according to 
their 
degree of compliance with those criteria. The lack of precision regarding 
the 
selection criteria allowed the EIF to exercise a high level of discretion 
in 
evaluating the applications. 
Insufficient records justifying the agreement parameters 
51.	The two main parameters of the guarantee agreements are the reference 
volume and the guarantee cap rate. The reference volume represents the 
amount 
of guarantees or financing which the intermediary could â€œreasonably be 
expected 
to achieve [â€¦] in the absence of the EU guaranteeâ€ . The reference volume 
further serves as a basis for the computation of additional agreement 
parameters. 
The guarantee cap rate  refers to the maximum amount of losses for which 
the 
EIF is liable under a guarantee agreement. Both parameters are key 
factors as 
they will determine:
(a)	whether the EU intervention is additional to the guarantee schemeâ€™s 
existing 
level of activity or simply replaces it; and
(b)	the maximum level of budgetary exposure the EU is expected to face 
under a 
specific agreement.
52.	In accordance with the FMA and with the Guidance on Enhanced Access 
to 
Finance, the volumes, including the reference volume, are determined on 
the 
basis of the EIFâ€™s professional judgement, based on past budgets and loss 
rates 
or forecasts (especially for public guarantee schemes) and considering 
the market 
conditions and their evolution over time. 
53.	Weaknesses were found in the EIFâ€™s documentation relating to the 
setting of 
the agreement parameters, including the reference volume and the cap 
rate. Only 
a summary of the results of the due-diligence step is included in the 
EIFâ€™s request 
for the Board of Directorsâ€™ approval. When setting these parameters, the 
EIF 
takes as a basis the information provided by the financial intermediary. 
No 
evidence was found that the EIF verified this information.
Policy objectives not fully defined in the guarantee agreements
54.	Each guarantee agreement should contribute to the achievement of the 
policy 
objectives by specifying exactly what should be achieved. The general 
undertakings applicable to every intermediary in the guarantee agreements 
include principles of enhanced access to finance. These principles are 
derived 
from the broader objectives set out in the legal basis  and in the FMA 
and reflect 
these objectives appropriately. Box 4 presents the principles applicable 
to the 
loan window.
Box 4 - Principles of enhanced access to finance as per guarantee 
agreement (loan window)
The purpose of this agreement is the provision of a guarantee by the ElF 
to the 
intermediary in order to partially cover the intermediaryâ€™s portfolio 
risk with a 
view to:

(i) enhancing SMEs' access to finance;
(ii) reducing the particular difficulties that SMEs face in accessing 
finance, 
either due to the perceived higher risk associated with investment in 
certain 
knowledge-related activities such as technological development, 
innovation 
and technology transfer, or due to the lack of sufficient collateral; and
(iii) stimulating job-creation by supporting SMEs with growth and 
employment 
creation.

55.	Besides these general provisions, specific financial intermediary 
guarantee 
terms may include â€œfurther qualitative undertakings in respect of 
enhanced access 
to financeâ€. However, some of the intermediary guarantee terms are 
inconsistent 
with the objectives of the CIP or provide little operational guidance. 
For instance: 
-	in respect of the lack of collateral aspect it was found for one 
intermediary 
that â€œin addition to complying with any relevant provision of this 
agreement 
[â€¦] the intermediary undertakes [â€¦] to require a low collateral level in 
relation 
to intermediary transactionsâ€. In this case the specific terms of the 
agreement 
translate the general conditions relating to the lack of collateral into 
reduced 
collateral requirements. However, this allows de facto all SMEs to 
benefit 
from the reduced collateral requirements and does not ensure that only 
SMEs 
effectively lacking collateral, and thus unable to borrow under usual 
commercial terms, benefit from the facility; and
-	the specific terms of the agreements leave broad discretion in the 
matter of 
interpretation of innovation. The same guarantee agreement stated, 
without 
providing any further explanation, â€œ[â€¦] the intermediary undertakes [â€¦] 
to 
enter into intermediary transactions with newly created SMEs or SMEs 
involved in innovative projectsâ€.
Performance monitoring and reporting
56.	Effective monitoring and reporting requires relevant, reliable and 
timely 
information on the status of the policy implementation and the extent to 
which the 
policy objectives are being met. 
57.	Performance monitoring of the SMEG facility is carried out by both 
the 
Commission and the EIF (see Annex II). The information flows from the 
SMEs 
(i.e. final beneficiaries) through one or more layers (in the case of co- 
or counter-
guarantees) of financial intermediaries to the EIF and finally to the 
Commission. 
Financial intermediaries report to the EIF on a quarterly basis on the 
SMEG 
facility. Based on this information, the EIF prepares quarterly 
consolidated reports 
for the Commission, which then uses these reports for the annual 
implementation 
reports on the EIP and on the CIP. 
58.	The Court examined the following aspects of performance monitoring 
and 
reporting:
-	whether the Commission established a balanced set of performance 
indicators to reliably measure the status of policy implementation; and
-	whether the reporting requirements are clear and reasonable.
Performance indicators were established, but should be more stable and 
balanced
59.	The prerequisite for effective monitoring (i.e. to measure progress 
of the 
implementation of the SMEG facility) is the definition of a set of clear 
indicators 
and associated targets. Indicators should be relatively stable so that 
changes over 
time can be observed and compared. 
60.	The SMEG performance indicators should contribute to an assessment of 
the 
achievement of the programmeâ€™s specific objectives as laid down in the 
legal 
basis and the global objectives of the European Union policy from which 
these 
objectives are derived. 
61.	For SMEG the Commission established six indicators (see Table 4).

2	One job created or maintained for each SME receiving new financing. 
The Commission considers 
that as the data of the Growth and Employment initiative indicate that 
beneficiary SMEs created 
on average 1.2 jobs, a more conservative ratio should be used to account 
for the fact that micro-
credit guarantee corresponds to more than 20 % of all companies reached 
by SMEG and thus, 
fewer jobs are expected to be created by these companies bringing down 
the overall average.
3	The information can be found in the EIF quarterly reports only.
62.	Of the four indicators (numbers 2, 3, 5, and 6) included in the ex-
ante 
evaluation and in the EIP 2009 Work Programme, only two were carried over 
(numbers 2 and 3) to the Commissionâ€™s EIP Implementation Report. In the 
EIP 
2010 Work Programme, two initial indicators were dropped (numbers 5 and 
6) and 
two new indicators were added (numbers 1 and 4). These changes, made in 
2010, were a reaction to a study on the evaluation of the indicators . 
63.	In the ex-ante evaluation only two indicators (numbers 2 and 3) had 
target 
values assigned to them. The EIP 2009 and 2010 Work Programmes did not 
set 
targets for the indicators to achieve in the respective period. In the 
absence of 
target values, it is difficult to assess whether the programme is 
developing as 
expected.
64.	Even though the Commission tried to create a balanced set of 
measurable 
indicators, including output, impact and result indicators, the only 
result indicator 
(number 5) was not carried over and was finally dropped by the 
Commission. The 
only impact indicator (number 2) is problematic (see paragraphs 67 and 
68) and 
all remaining indicators are output indicators. Thus, the indicators have 
become 
more of an instrument of operational management than an indicator to 
measure 
the impact and the success of the programme. It is difficult to strike 
the right 
balance between collecting the data economically and monitoring 
performance 
effectively. The evaluators of the EIP indicators suggested a set of 
balanced 
indicators including data collection methods and timing . 
65.	If meaningful conclusions as to the achievements of the SMEG 
programme 
are to be drawn, it is essential that the monitoring data provided by the 
financial 
intermediaries should be reliable, i.e. accurate and complete. 
66.	The financial intermediaries visited by the Court had all established 
procedures for collecting the data necessary for reporting to the EIF. 
The quality 
of the reporting processes at intermediary level is checked during the 
on-site 
monitoring visits by the EIF. 
67.	The collection of data related to â€œthe number of jobs createdâ€ 
indicator poses 
difficulties for some financial intermediaries. In some countries the 
data are 
obtained from governmental institutions , some financial intermediaries 
collected 
them on a sample basis , others made calculations using expected values  
or 
the financial intermediaries did not update employment data annually as 
it would 
be too burdensome . Since the quality of employment data varies from 
country to 
country, adding them up raises concerns as to the reliability of the 
value of the 
indicator concerning the number of jobs created (number 2).
68.	Another problem with this indicator is that the values are taken from 
the 
number of persons employed by the supported SMEs, which is not equivalent 
to 
the number of jobs created or maintained at SMEs receiving new financing. 
The 
new financing received by an SME is not the only factor which leads to 
maintaining or creating jobs. There is no analysis as to how the 
guaranteed loan 
contributed to maintaining or creating jobs. 
Reporting requirements are clear and reasonable and only some financial 
intermediaries consider them a burden
69.	Financial intermediaries should have clear reporting requirements in 
order to 
collect the data for monitoring and reporting on the SMEG programme. Time 
and 
resources to obtain the required information for the indicators should 
not create an 
unnecessary administrative burden. 
70.	Financial intermediaries are required to collect various data on the 
supported 
SMEs and report to the EIF on a regular basis (see Annex III). Reporting 
requirements are listed in the guarantee agreement between the EIF and 
the 
financial intermediary. To this end, clear guidelines  have been issued 
by the EIF 
to the financial intermediaries as to how to compile the requested data. 
Corroborating this statement, 88 % of the financial intermediaries agreed 
that the 
operational instructions provided by the EIF were clear . Furthermore, 98 
% of 
the financial intermediaries stated that the EIF is always willing to 
provide further 
information to clarify operational issues . 
71.	The results of the Courtâ€™s questionnaire also showed that only 20 % 
of 
financial intermediaries participating under the CIP and/or the MAP find 
the 
reporting requirements unreasonable . 
72.	In cases where data collection through financial intermediaries poses 
a lot of 
difficulties (for example, employment data), alternative methods of 
collecting 
information could have been more appropriate. Both reports, â€œEvaluation 
of the 
Indicators of the EIPâ€ and the â€œInterim evaluation of the EIPâ€, suggested 
using 
surveys in the context of an evaluation.
Achievements of the SMEG facility
73.	This section describes the outputs delivered by the SMEG facility. 
The outputs 
are analysed in relation to the facilityâ€™s objectives. Furthermore, the 
European 
added value of the facility is examined, in particular whether the 
facilityâ€™s 
objectives are better achieved by implementation at Community level than 
at 
national or regional level.
Outputs of the SMEG facility
74.	The CIP financial instruments should â€œimprove (â€¦) access to finance 
for the 
start-up and growth of SMEs and investment in innovation activities â€. 
More 
specifically, the SMEG facility under CIP sets out to: 
-	reach 315 750 SMEs ;
-	guarantee loans that finance SMEsâ€™ innovative investments  or are 
provided 
to SMEs lacking sufficient collateral; and therefore
-	enhance access to finance where the market fails.
75.	The following analysis was based on a review of the loan sample 
selected by 
the Court . As regards investments in certain knowledge-related 
activities such 
as technological development, innovation and technology transfer, 
reference is 
made to the OECD Oslo Manual for the measurement of scientific and 
technological activities . 
The overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs is attainable
76.	All financial intermediaries visited clearly targeted SMEs and all 
had 
procedures in place to verify the SME status of the borrower.
77.	As regards the overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs , the 
Commission 
and the EIF made a successful effort to overcome the consequences of the 
initial 
delay (see paragraph 32) by concentrating on the larger financial 
intermediaries. 
In the three years since the CIP came in force, the EIF has signed 25 
deals with 
21 financial intermediaries (see Table 2). At the end of 2009, the total 
guarantee 
cap amount  of these guarantee agreements stood at 191,1 million euro, 
representing 37,5 % of the overall budget for the SMEG facility. The 
financial 
intermediaries had provided loans to almost 59 000 SMEs, representing 19 
% of 
the target number of SMEs. Taking into account the results from the MAP, 
the 
signed guarantee agreements reach more than half of the target number of 
SMEs 
(57,4 %) if the maximum portfolio amount is reached for each of these 
agreements  (see Figure 3). Therefore, the progress in implementation is 
sufficient to expect that the overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs 
will be 
attained.
Figure 3 - Outputs of the SMEG facility under CIP as at the end of 2009

The facility reaches SMEs which lack collateral; innovative projects are 
scarce
78.	The SMEG facility is designed to enhance access to debt funding for 
SMEs 
that have viable projects but are unable to secure a loan from commercial 
lenders. 
Such a situation can occur if an SME does not have sufficient collateral 
to fulfil the 
requirements of a commercial lender. Alternatively, the SME can be denied 
access to loan financing if the commercial lenders are not in a position 
to easily 
estimate the viability of the business proposition, as might be the case 
for 
innovative investments. The more novel the investment, the less likely it 
is that a 
loan will be granted.
79.	Based on the responses to the Courtâ€™s questionnaire, the CIP 
financial 
intermediaries aimed to target primarily SMEs without sufficient 
collateral, 
secondly micro enterprises and then start-ups. The innovative SMEs 
represent 
the category that is least targeted. While 90 % of the intermediaries 
agreed with 
the statement that their CIP-guaranteed product was aimed at customers 
that did 
not have sufficient collateral, only approximately half of the 
intermediaries agreed 
with the statement that their CIP-guaranteed product was aimed at 
innovative 
SMEs (see Figure 4).
Figure 4 - Survey of Financial Intermediaries â€“ SMEs targeted by the 
guarantee/loan product
 
Source: ECA questionnaire to the financial intermediaries.
80.	The analysis of the loan sample shows that SMEs with a lack of 
collateral 
benefited more often than SMEs that were carrying out innovative 
investments. 
Out of the 181 loans in the sample, 77 loans (43 %) were provided to SMEs 
that 
lacked sufficient collateral to gain access to finance through existing 
commercial 
lending. Only 22 loans (12 %) were used to finance projects that had 
innovative 
aspects (see Table 5).

1 In the cases where a financial intermediary defined the level of 
sufficient collateral or this level 
could be implicitly deduced, this was applied to determine the 
â€œsufficiencyâ€ of the collateral. In the 
remaining cases, an SME was considered to possess sufficient collateral 
if the loan amount did 
not exceed 70 % of the value of realisable assets. In the latter 
category, other factors which 
increased the risk profile of the SME were also taken into account (e.g. 
loans to unemployed) and 
as a result these SMEs were considered as â€œSMEs that lack sufficient 
collateralâ€.
Source: European Court of Auditors.
81.	Although innovative investments were rare, the loan sample included 
some 
highly innovative investments. Half of the innovative projects (11 out of 
22) were 
assessed as market-new or world-new types of innovation. These projects 
aimed 
at creating new or significantly improved products, production processes 
or 
delivery methods that were new at least for the operating market of the 
enterprise. 
For an example of such an investment, see Box 5. The remaining innovative 
investments could be described as a novelty only for the enterprise 
concerned, 
and were already being implemented by other firms that were directly 
competing 
with the borrower.


Box 5 - Example of an innovative project
The entrepreneur did not have sufficient collateral to secure a normal 
commercial 
loan of 40 000 euro. However, in his previous job as a researcher he had 
acquired 
significant knowledge about the production of vinegar. He therefore, used 
the 
guaranteed loan to start up a company producing high-quality vinegar. The 
production process used specifically cultivated bacteria that made the 
fermentation process more stable. The resulting vinegar had a better 
taste and 
higher sugar content â€“ qualities appreciated by consumers. The companyâ€™s 
operating market was regional and there were no other competitors using 
the 
same production process.
82.	However, for 23 loans no assessment could be made regarding the 
reported 
lack of collateral due to the absence of information at the financial 
intermediaries. 
Financial intermediaries strive for additional lending volumes, but more 
attention 
could have been paid to deadweight
83.	In guarantee schemes, â€œdeadweightâ€ occurs if the borrower could have 
obtained the loan from commercial lenders without public support. In such 
situations, the effects, such as creation of jobs, economic or innovation 
activity, 
would have been realised anyway. Publicly supported guarantee schemes are 
most effective when the financed investment would otherwise not have been 
carried out, and the desired effects would not have been realised. 
84.	To ensure that the SMEG facility provides additional access to 
finance for 
SMEs, the Commission has developed Guidance on Enhanced Access to 
Finance. This aims to ensure that the financial intermediary can use the 
portfolio 
guarantee only after the actual lending volume exceeds the lending volume 
that 
the intermediary would have achieved without the guarantee. This concept 
of 
additionality is simple to use and can be easily embedded into the 
guarantee 
agreement.
85.	However, additionality does not ensure that the additional volume at 
the level 
of the financial intermediary is also additional at the level of the 
economy. In the 
context of the SMEG facility, it is considered that deadweight occurs if 
guarantees 
are provided for loans to SMEs with sufficient collateral and without 
innovative 
investments. However, when providing assistance on protfolio basis, a 
certain 
level of deadweight is inevitable. The loan analysis revealed deadweight 
in more 
than a third of the loans in the sample (38 %, 69 out of 181, see Table 
5). Other 
things being equal, these borrowers could have obtained the loans from 
commercial lenders without the SME guarantee. A survey of the MAP 
borrowers 
conducted by the interim evaluator showed a similar level of deadweight .
Specific lending conditions
86.	Each guarantee agreement between the EIF and the financial 
intermediary 
contains a standard clause listing the principles of enhanced access to 
finance 
(see paragraph 54) for the benefit of SMEs without collateral or with 
innovative 
investments. There is not always a clear indication as to how the 
financial 
intermediary intends to target them. Some financial intermediaries used 
specific 
lending conditions to attract such SMEs, thus minimising deadweight (see 
Box 6).
Box 6 - Lending conditions to attract either innovative SMEs or SMEs 
without 
sufficient collateral 
*	The guaranteed loans can be provided only to start-ups and SMEs with 
a short 
business history
*	Ceiling on the loan amount
*	Providing non-monetary benefits to the SMEs  so that the guaranteed 
loans 
are not cheaper than non-guaranteed loans
*	Higher guarantee rates for investments that are innovative or 
constitute to 
some extent a novelty

87.	While the first three lending conditions will lead to automatic 
preference for 
borrowers that lack collateral, the last condition will probably increase 
the interest 
of innovative SMEs. The relative absence of lending conditions geared 
towards 
innovative SMEs may explain the low number of innovative investments 
found in 
the sample (see Table 5).
European added value
88.	As all the fields covered by the CIP are the shared responsibility of 
the 
Member States and the Community , the SMEG facility also has to respect 
the 
subsidiarity principle stipulated in Article 5 of the Treaty. EU actions 
not falling 
within the exclusive competence of the Union, such as the SMEG facility, 
should 
be undertaken only if, and in so far, as the objectives of the proposed 
action 
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by 
reason 
of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at the 
EU level.
89.	The concept of subsidiarity is reiterated in a recital preceding the 
CIP 
decision , in the CIP proposal  and in the CIP impact assessment . In 
essence, 
the arguments used by the Commission in favour of the EU dimension of the 
financial instruments can be grouped under two headings:
-	ensuring coherence in implementation; and 
-	the global nature of competition and innovation.
The SMEG facility may have sizeable non-monetary benefits for an 
intermediary; 
however consistency of implementation is not actively striven for
90.	In its CIP preparatory documents, the Commission argued that the 
European 
dimension would ensure diffusion of good practice in the delivery of 
financial 
instruments, including the SMEG facility. Although similar measures exist 
in some 
Member States, the Community intervention will contribute to the 
consistency of 
implementation.
91.	Several cases were found in which the financing from the EU budget 
was 
crucial, not only as a partial coverage of the credit losses, but also 
because it 
allowed the intermediary to try something new. In two instances the SMEG 
facility 
helped with the development of guarantee or lending products that were 
new to 
the intermediary. For one of them, multiple attempts had to be made until 
the 
product gained sufficient recognition from the on-lending banks and the 
clients. It 
can be assumed that the product would not have been developed if the EIF 
and 
the Commission had not repeatedly collaborated with that intermediary. 
Furthermore, cooperation with the EU institutions may help smaller 
private 
financial intermediaries especially to gain recognition among the on-
lending banks 
and/or their clients. 
92.	This is corroborated by the result of the questionnaire sent to the 
financial 
intermediaries. 6 out of 31 CIP intermediaries  have developed a new loan 
or 
guarantee product and 16 out of 31 have significantly modified their 
existing 
products to participate in the CIP. 
93.	The SMEG facility increases the visibility of EU support among 
financial 
intermediaries. The audit visits showed that awareness of the EU 
guarantees 
among SMEs was not very high. However, actively driven attempts to ensure 
consistency between the practices of different intermediaries were not 
observed. 
The EIF simply collects the information about the practices of the 
financial 
intermediaries, but does not question these practices. As has been shown 
in the 
case of lending conditions (see paragraph 86), a more active approach by 
the EIF 
might improve take-up of the facility by SMEs with innovative projects or 
insufficient collateral.
The SMEG facility increases the competitiveness of individual 
enterprises; this 
does not imply that European added value is delivered
94.	This aspect of European added value is directly related to one of the CIP 
global 
objectives: â€œto foster the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular 
of SMEsâ€ . 
In the preparatory documents, the Commission argued that the competition 
European firms face is increasingly global and innovation is seen as a 
global 
phenomenon that is not successful and sustainable in a closed 
environment.
95.	The loan analysis showed that the SMEG facility does indeed help 
individual 
enterprises to increase their competitiveness. It was found that 74 out 
of 
181 loans (41 %) were directly used to increase the enterpriseâ€™s 
competitiveness . The SMEG facility delivers many other valuable results 
in 
relation to the creation of a more competitive environment. It enables 
small start-
ups - mainly in the service sector - to emerge. Out of the 181 loans in 
the sample, 
26 loans (14 %) were used to start a new business and 15 loans (8 %) were 
used 
to finance post-start-up expansions of the business . It also helps to 
maintain the 
competitive landscape allowing individuals to become entrepreneurs by 
buying an 
existing SME (47 loans, 26 %).
96.	However, the European added value of these results is not conclusive as the 
same 
effects could be achieved with funding from national budgets. For 
instance, the 
Commission  gives three suggestions on how an EU policy may impact 
competitiveness at the EU level . The EU policy might:
-	have an impact on the competitive position of EU firms in comparison 
with 
their non-EU rivals;
-	stimulate cross-border investment flows, including relocation of 
economic 
activity; or 
-	be necessary to correct undesirable outcomes of market processes in 
European markets.
97.	None of these effects were observed during the audit. The loan 
analysis 
confirmed that most of the SMEs are operating in local, regional or 
national 
markets. 19 out of 181 loans (10 %) were provided to SMEs that had some 
cross-
border activities and 13 loans (7 %) were used for investments that had a 
significant cross-border element . The scarcity of cross-border 
activities is not 
surprising given the types of businesses of the SMEs in the sample (for 
an 
overview, see Figure 5): 17 restaurants, 8 taxi drivers, 41 small retail 
shops 
(bakery, butcher, newspaper shop or supermarket) or 17 craftsmen 
(carpenter, 
electrician, mason or roofer). Given these examples of borrowers whose 
businesses are usually local, the need for EU intervention is not 
sufficiently 
demonstrated.
Figure 5 - Loan Analysis â€“ Types of Businesses 
 
Source: European Court of Auditors.
98.	Indeed, the scale of the individual guarantee deals does not go 
beyond 
national borders. In essence the SMEG facility operates as a set of 
national 
guarantee schemes, because there are significant differences between the 
national debt markets . These differences are caused by cultural as well 
as legal 
constraints and are so significant that the debt markets can be 
considered to be 
purely national.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Design of the SMEG facility
99.	Although no explicit intervention logic was provided in the CIP 
preparatory 
documents for the SMEG facility, an implicit intervention logic can be 
found in the 
different preparatory documents of the CIP Decision. However, there is no 
conceptual link between the problem at stake and the expected results and 
impacts as presented before the start of the intervention. Although the 
objectives 
are now more precise than under the previous MAP programme, they are only 
specific, measurable, achievable and timed in relation to the expected 
outputs. 
Recommendation 1
Future SME support programmes should be based upon an explicit 
intervention 
logic linking the inputs to the expected outputs, results and impacts. 
Setting the management structure
100.	Overall an appropriate framework has been established for the 
management 
of the SMEG facility. The fee structure has been improved compared to MAP 
by 
adding performance triggered incentives. However, delays in the planning 
of the 
facility prevented effective budget allocation during the first year and 
caused an 
interruption of the support for some financial intermediaries.
Recommendation 2
For the purpose of planning any subsequent facility, the Court recommends 
finalising the legal basis and the management agreement well before the 
effective 
start of the programming period in order to have time to select adequate 
financial 
intermediaries and to complete contract negotiations with them by the 
effective 
start of the programming period, thus avoiding the need to have recourse 
to any 
retroactivity clause in the future.
Selection of financial intermediaries
101.	The Commission devised appropriate procedures for the selection of 
financial intermediaries. However, no scoring standards were established 
to rate 
the applications from the different potential intermediaries and no 
minimum 
requirements are defined for the different selection criteria. Weaknesses 
were 
found in the documentation of the parameters setting in the guarantee 
agreements with financial intermediaries. 
Recommendation 3
To enhance the transparency of the selection, a scoring system for the 
assessment of potential intermediary applications should be put in place 
for any 
successor programme. Minimum requirements should be defined for the 
selection 
of financial intermediaries. The calculation of the parameters in the 
guarantee 
agreements should be documented in greater detail. 
Performance monitoring and reporting 
102.	Sufficient output indicators were established which were used to 
report on  
SMEGâ€™s implementation. The data for the only impact indicator which 
refers to the 
â€œnumber of jobs createdâ€ is difficult to collect and, due to varying 
calculation 
methods, not comparable between countries. Reporting requirements are 
clear 
and not perceived as a burden by a majority of the financial 
intermediaries 
participating in SMEG.
Recommendation 4
The Commission should consider the scope for creating additional or 
better 
performance indicators in order to monitor better the achievements of the 
facilityâ€™s 
objectives and draw appropriate conclusions. 
Achievements of the SMEG facility
103.	The only quantified target, that of reaching 315 750 SMEs, is 
likely to be 
achieved. The analysis of the Courtâ€™s sample of loans showed that less 
than half 
of the loans (43 %) were given to SMEs that had a lack of sufficient 
collateral and 
only 12 % used the loans for innovative investments. The loan analysis 
revealed a 
deadweight of 38 %, i.e. loans made to SMEs with sufficient collateral 
and not 
using them for innovation.
Recommendation 5
The Commission should in future set more specific targets which better 
reflect the 
objectives of the financial instrument. During the lifetime of the 
instrument 
monitoring should measure progress towards achieving such targets, 
allowing 
remedial action to be taken as necessary. Appropriate measures to 
minimise 
deadweight should be envisaged, drawing inter alia on best practices 
already in 
place at certain intermediaries.
104.	The SMEG facility enabled some financial intermediaries to develop 
and 
offer new lending or guarantee products, but no active identification and 
dissemination of good practices is undertaken. The European added value of SMEG 
is 
not demonstrated as the results from SMEG might also have been achieved 
by 
funding under national schemes. Significant cross-border investments or 
effects of 
the SMEG loans were not observed. 
Recommendation 6
As the Court emphasised in the past, expenditure from the Union budget 
must 
offer clear and visible benefits for the EU and for its citizens which 
could not be 
achieved by spending only at national, regional or local level.  The 
Budgetary 
authorities and the Commission should therefore consider how EU added 
value 
could be maximised in any successor to the SMEG facility.

volume by the guarantee rate and the guarantee cap rate. E.g. portfolio 
volume =

Executive summary
High-speed rail is a comfortable, safe, flexible and environmentally sustainable mode of transport. It brings environmental performance and socio-economic benefits which can support the EUâ€™s transport and cohesion policy objectives. Since 2000, the EU has provided 23.7Â billion euro of co-funding to support high-speed rail infrastructure investments.
We carried out a performance audit on the long-term strategic planning of high-speed lines in the EU, on the cost-efficiency (assessing construction costs, delays, cost overruns and the use of high-speed lines which received EU co-funding), and on the sustainability and European added value of EU co-funding. We carried out our audit in six Member States, analysing expenditure for more than 5Â 000 km of infrastructure on ten high-speed rail lines and four border crossings, covering around 50Â % of the high-speed rail lines in Europe. 
We found that the EUâ€™s current long-term plan is not supported by credible analysis, is unlikely to be achieved, and lacks a solid EU-wide strategic approach. Although the length of the national high-speed rail networks is growing, the Commissionâ€™s 2011 target of tripling the number of kilometres of high-speed rail lines by 2030 will not be reached: 9Â 000Â km of high-speed line are currently in use, and around 1Â 700Â km of line was under construction in 2017. On average, it takes around 16Â years for new high-speed lines to proceed from the start of works to the beginning of operations.
There is no European high-speed rail network, and the Commission has no legal tools and no powers in the decision making to ensure that Member States make rapid progress towards completing the core network corridors set out in the TEN-T Regulation. As a result, there is only a patchwork of national high-speed lines, planned and built by the Member States in isolation. This patchwork system has been constructed without proper coordination across borders: high-speed lines crossing national borders are not amongst the national priorities for construction, even though international agreements have been signed and provisions have been included in the TEN-T Regulation requiring core network corridors to be built by 2030. This means a low European added value of the EU co-funding of high-speed rail infrastructure investments. 
The quality of the assessment of real needs in the Member States is low, and the alternative solution of upgrading existing conventional lines is not often given due consideration, even though the savings achieved when this option is used can be significant. The decision to build high-speed lines is often based on political considerations, and cost-benefit analyses are not used generally as a tool to support cost-efficient decision-making.
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive, and is becoming more so: on average, the lines we audited cost 25Â million euro per km (not taking into account the more expensive tunnelling projects). The costs involved could in fact have been far lower, with little or no impact on operations. This is because very high-speed lines are not needed everywhere they have been built. In many cases, trains run on very high-speed lines at far lower average speeds than the line is designed to handle. The cost of a line increases proportionally with the design speed, and infrastructure capable of handling very high-speed operations (300Â km/h or more) is particularly costly. Such high- speeds, however, are never reached in practice: trains run on average at only around 45Â % of the lineâ€™s design speed on the lines audited, and only two lines were operating at an average speed above 200Â km/h, and none above 250Â km/h. Average speed so far below the design speed raises questions as to sound financial management.
We also analysed the cost per minute saved by the introduction of high-speed rail. We found that four of the ten lines we audited will cost more than one hundred million euro per minute saved. The highest figure is on the Stuttgart â€“ Munich line, which will cost 369Â million euro per minute saved. Cost overruns, which are covered by national budgets, and delays were the norm instead of the exception. Aggregate cost overruns for the lines and projects we audited were 5.7 billion euro at project level, and 25.1 billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). Delays at project and line level were also significant: eight of the 30 projects we audited had been delayed by at least one year, and five lines (half of the sample audited) had experienced delays of more than one decade. Paying careful attention to the elements above could save hundreds of millions of euros, and ensure that good use is made of lines which are built.
To gain insight into how high-speed rail benefits EU citizens, we also analysed and compared door-to-door travel times, prices and number of connections for high-speed rail and its competitors (air transport, conventional rail and road transport). We concluded that total travel time and price level are both important factors for success. Combined with effectively regular services, these factors could allow high-speed rail to increase its market share. Intermodal competition is fierce, and it affects the sustainability of high-speed lines: high-speed rail does not compete on an equal basis with other transport modes. 
We assess sustainability of the EU co-funding to be at risk. Judging by a benchmark, a high-speed line should ideally have nine million passengers per year to be successful. However, on three of the seven completed high-speed lines we audited, the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6 billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7 billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines. Our assessment of the number of people living in the catchment areas of the audited lines indicates that nine of the 14 audited lines and cross-border connections did not have enough potential passengers to be successful. These include the three lines indicated above carrying a lower number of passengers compared to the benchmark of nine million. 
In 2010, we issued a report calling for urgent action to lift all technical, administrative and other barriers to rail interoperability. However, we found that these barriers still persist in 2018. The rail passenger market is not open in France and Spain. There is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria; in these Member States, services were more frequent and of higher quality, whereas ticket prices were lower. Integrated ticketing systems, and greater attention paid to monitoring and standardising customer satisfaction and punctuality data, could further improve the passenger experience.
For a successful continuation of EU co-funding for high-speed rail infrastructure in the next programming period, we recommend that the Commission should take a number of steps. These include:
carrying out realistic long-term planning; and agreeing with the Member States the key strategic stretches to be implemented first, with close monitoring and enforceable powers to ensure that commitments to complete the core EU high-speed rail network are respected; 
making EU co-funding support linked to earmarked strategic priority projects, effective on-track competition and achievement of results;
simplifying cross-border constructions with regard to tendering procedures, the use of â€œone-stop-shopsâ€ for the formalities, and the lifting of all remaining barriers; 
actions to improve seamless high-speed rail operations for passengers, such as, for example, e-ticketing, simplification of track access charges and improving the reporting to citizens on punctuality and customer satisfaction data.



Introduction
High-speed rail in Europe
High-speed rail in Europe took off after the 1974Â petrol crisis. Europeâ€™s energy dependency threatened internal mobility, so several Member States decided to develop a safe, fast, comfortable and ecological mode of transport in the form of high-speed rail lines. Italy was the first European country to inaugurate a high-speed rail line: the line from Florence and Rome opened in 1977. Shortly afterwards, France inaugurated its own â€œTrains Ã  Grande Vitesseâ€ lines. Germanyâ€™s first high-speed lines, served by â€œIntercity Expressâ€ (ICE) trains, opened in the early 1990s, whereas Spainâ€™s â€œAlta Velocidad EspaÃ±olaâ€ (AVE) high-speed service commenced operations in 1992.
There is currently no single European high-speed rail network: instead, different operational models exist in different Member States (FigureÂ 1). For example, there are mixed high-speed systems (in France, Spain and Italy) and fully mixed high-speed lines (Germany, Austria and two sections in Italy).
FigureÂ 1 - Operational models for high-speed rail traffic

The EUâ€™s high-speed rail network is growing in size and in rate of utilisation
At the end of 2017, the EU had 9Â 067 km of high-speed lines (FigureÂ 2; AnnexÂ I provides a detailed map). This network is expanding: 1Â 671Â km are currently under construction. Once all planned high-speed rail infrastructure investments have been completed, Spain will have the second-longest high-speed rail network in the world, after China.

Source: EU Statistical Pocketbook 2017; UIC. Note: This chart includes only lines (or sections of lines) on which trains can exceed 250Â km/h at some point during their journey.
The number of passengers using high-speed rail in Europe is growing steadily: from roughly 15Â billion passenger-kilometres (pkm) in 1990, demand reached more than 124Â billion pkm in 2016. In 2015, high-speed rail services accounted for more than a quarter (26Â %) of all rail passenger travel in the Member States where high-speed services are available. 
EU policies for high-speed rail
Transport policy
The Trans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) programme plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It serves the goals of economic development, regional competitiveness, regional and social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. It also establishes key links needed to facilitate transport, optimising the capacity of existing infrastructure, producing specifications for network interoperability, and integrating environmental concerns. TEN-Tâ€™s objectives include the interconnection and interoperability of national transport networks, the optimal integration and interconnection of all transport modes, and the efficient use of infrastructure.
The latest Commission 2011 Transport White Paper (WP) has set the following specific passenger traffic targets for high-speed rail: (i) By 2030, the length of the existing high-speed rail network should be tripled so that, by 2050, most medium-distance passenger transport should be by rail (a 50Â % shift of medium-distance intercity passenger and freight journeys from road to rail). High-speed rail should grow faster than air transport for journeys of up to 1Â 000Â km, and by 2050, all core network airports should be connected to the rail network, preferably by high-speed services.
To advance on these goals, in December 2013, the EU adopted a new transport infrastructure policy that aims to close the gaps between the transport networks of Member States, to remove bottlenecks that still hamper the smooth functioning of the internal market, and to overcome technical barriers (e.g. incompatible standards for railway traffic). The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) instrument, adopted at the same time, supports these objectives financially.
Cohesion policy
Since 2000, the Structural Funds have been required to operate in a manner consistent with other EU policies, such as transport. Under both the ERDF and the CF Regulations, support has been provided to investments contributing to the establishment and development of TEN-T networks, as well as to transport infrastructure projects of common interest. 
Under the current 2014-2020 cohesion-policy framework, the EU cohesion-policy funds still support transport infrastructure but, to increase the effectiveness of EU co-funding, â€œex-ante conditionalitiesâ€ have been introduced. This means that Member States must demonstrate that proposed projects will be implemented within the framework of a comprehensive national, or regional, long-term transport plan, adopted by all interested and involved stakeholders.
EU support for building high-speed lines: significant, but a fraction of total cost
From 2000 to 2017, the EU provided 23.7Â billion euro in grants to co-finance high-speed rail infrastructure investments, as well as 4.4Â billion euro in support to install ERTMS on high-speed rail lines. Some 14.6Â billion euro of co-funding, or 62Â % of the total, was provided under shared-management funding mechanisms (the ERDF and the CF), while the directly managed investment schemes (e.g. the CEF) provided 9.1Â billion euro, or 38Â %. EU co-funding can be used to support studies as well as infrastructure works, both for new high-speed lines and for upgrades to existing conventional rail lines to allow them to accommodate high-speed operations.
In addition to this aid, since 2000, the EIB has also provided loans to the value of 29.7Â billion euro to support the construction of high-speed rail lines.
Almost half of the EU funding made available for high-speed rail investments (more than 11Â billion euro) was allocated to investments in Spain. In all, 21.8Â billion euro â€“ 92.7Â % of the total â€“ was allocated to seven Member States (FigureÂ 3 and AnnexÂ II).
FigureÂ 3 - Overview of EU co-funding for high-speed rail by Member State (2000-2017)

Although these sums are significant, EU co-funding represents a small fraction of the overall amounts invested in high-speed rail infrastructure works in the EU. For example, depending on the funding instruments used, the co-funding rate ranged from 2Â % in Italy to 26Â % in Spain. On average, EU co-funding covered around 11Â % of total construction cost.
Audit scope and approach
We carried out an audit on the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of EU co-funding for high-speed rail infrastructure investments since 2000. We assessed: (i) whether high-speed lines in the EU had been built according to a long-term strategic plan; (ii) whether high-speed rail projects had been implemented in a cost-efficient manner (by assessing construction costs, delays, cost overruns and use of high-speed lines which received investment support); (iii) whether the investments were sustainable after project completion (including the impact of high-speed rail on competing transport modes), and (iv) whether EU co-funding had added value. In order to answer these questions, this report analyses the planning and decision making first, continues with an assessment of costs, than takes an EU-citizen approach by analysing travel times, prices, connections and stations, and finalises with the assessment of barriers and on-track competition to conclude on high-speed rail operations.
We used a series of audit procedures, such as document reviews and analyses of EU and national long-term strategic development plans for high-speed rail; interviews with staff from the Commission and from Member States; meetings with rail operators and infrastructure managers; and a survey of key stakeholders. We engaged external experts to assess: (i) the quality of cost-benefit analyses (CBA) and future-demand analyses; (ii) the access, connections and regeneration effects of selected high-speed rail stations; (iii) the Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam (PBA) high-speed line, and (iv) the prices, travel times and number of connections using different modes of transport. We also benchmarked our audit results with high-speed rail operations and passenger services in Japan and Switzerland.
We carried out our audit at the European Commission (DG MOVE, including the INEA and the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), and DG REGIO) and in six Member States (France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal and Austria). These Member States received 83.5Â % of all EU funding allocated to high-speed lines since 2000 (23.7Â billion euros, corresponding to 46Â euros per EU resident).
Using a combination of specific sampling criteria related to the amount of EU co-funding, the length of the line, and whether or not a capital city was linked to the line, we selected ten high-speed lines for audit. On account of their size, we audited four high-speed lines in Spain and two each in Germany, Italy and France. We also assessed four cross-border projects: the connections between Munich and Verona; Spain and France (both on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean side), and Spain and Portugal (FigureÂ 4).

Using high-speed lines as the basis for our audit allowed us to assess more than 5Â 000Â km of lines, either completed, under construction or in planning (for a detailed overview of the length of the lines audited, see TableÂ 4). This way, we covered more than 50Â % of the high-speed rail lines either in operation or under construction in the EU.
We also analysed 30Â EU co-funded projects on these high-speed lines (the largest projects under each management mode). The total proposed cost of the 30Â audited projects was 41.56Â billion euro. The amount of EU grants awarded to the audited projects was 6.18Â billion euro, of which 3.64Â billion euro had been paid by the time of the audit, and 967Â million euro decommitted (TableÂ 1).

The project-related expenditure we audited covered 2Â 100Â km of different types of high-speed rail infrastructure (trackbeds, tunnels, viaducts and overpasses). Without taking into account the Munich-Verona cross-border section projects, our project audit covered 45Â % of the entire length of the high-speed lines in the visited Member States. A full list of all projects audited, and the key observations, and findings from our analysis of whether their outputs, results and objectives had been achieved, are presented in AnnexÂ III.
Observations
EU co-funded investments in high-speed rail can be beneficial, but there is no solid EU-wide strategic approach
High-speed rail is a beneficial mode of transport which contributes to the EUâ€™s sustainable-mobility objectives
Investment in high-speed rail infrastructure and operations significantly benefits society as a whole, as it brings to passengers time savings, high levels of safety, security and comfort on-board. It frees up capacity on congested road and conventional rail networks, as well as airports. High-speed rail can also strengthen socio-economic dynamism, as well as contributing to the regeneration of depressed urban areas near stations. 
Although the relationship is not entirely straightforward, various bodies have concluded that high-speed rail also brings environmental benefits as trains have a lower carbon footprint than most other modes of transport.
The Commissionâ€™s powers are limited, and its plan to triple the length of the high-speed rail network is unlikely to be achieved
The Commissionâ€™s current long-term plan, set out in the 2011 White Paper and the CEF Regulation (Recital No 11), to triple the length of high-speed rail lines in the EU by 2030 (from 9Â 700Â km in 2008 to 30Â 750Â km by 2030) is not supported by credible analysis. Given the state of indebtedness of national public finances (Member State governments are the main investors), the limited return on this public investment, and the time it takes in practice to complete a high-speed rail investment, the goal of tripling the high-speed rail network is very unlikely to be achieved.
Our audit work suggests that the average time from the start of works to the beginning of operations is around 16Â years (TableÂ 2), even without taking into account the time needed for upfront planning. This is true even when projects which require lengthy major tunnelling works, such as the Brenner Base Tunnel on the Munich-Verona stretch, are excluded.

The TEN-T Regulation sets out the key infrastructure that Europe needs to build to support the EUâ€™s sustainable mobility goals. It describes which transport investments are to be ready by 2030 (the core network), and which ones are to be ready by 2050 (the comprehensive network). To complete the core network, the Commission has estimated that 500Â billion euro will be required, while 1.5Â trillion euro is needed for the comprehensive network.
The Commission has no say in decision-making, and it has no legal tools and no powers to hold Member States to their earlier commitments to build the high-speed lines needed to complete the core network. It also plays no role in decisions on cross-border links between two or more Member States, as the CEF and TEN-T Regulations lack a possibility for the Commission to enforce set EU priorities.
Member States plan and decide on their national networks, leading to a patchwork of poorly connected national high-speed networks
EU trans-national corridors are not a priority
Although the TEN-T Regulation defines in its annexes where the high-speed lines are to be built, the Member States alone decide if and when exactly this will happen. They also provide most of the required funding, and they alone are responsible for implementing all of the necessary steps (studies, permits, procuring and monitoring works, and supervising all parties involved). AnnexÂ IV provides key performance indicators for selected visited Member States, which highlight the different characteristics of their national networks. These indicators point that France is in the lead when it comes to use of high-speed lines (ratios of passenger km per capita and passenger kilometres per km of high speed lines); that Spain has the highest construction cost per capita (1Â 159 euro) and the highest EU co-funding for high-speed rail per capita (305 euro); and that Italy has the highest construction costs per km per capita (0.46 euro).
Within a Member State, many entities have a role to play, and various factors and parameters are crucial to whether or not construction proceed as initially planned. For example: 
the â€œEurocaprailâ€ project aimed to link Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg by high-speed rail, connecting Luxembourg with Brussels in 90Â minutes. At its December 1994 meeting in Essen, the Council deemed this project to be one of the 30Â â€œtop prioritiesâ€ for building (works to start not later than 2010, and completion by 2020). By 2004, however, this project was no longer considered a national priority by any single Member State. Even though the EU has provided 96.5Â million euro to upgrade the conventional line, journeys from Brussels to Luxembourg currently take up to 3Â hours and 17Â minutes. This is more than twice the objective set in 2003, and almost one hour slower than in 1980, when the same distance was covered in 2Â hours and 26Â minutes. As a result, many potential passengers simply travel by road;
Spain has invested in a new high-speed rail network. To support it in doing so, the EU has invested more than 14 billion euro in Spanish high-speed lines already since 1994. Trains in Spain traditionally used a wider gauge than the rest of Europe, but for the most part, the Spanish high-speed network uses the standard gauge found in the rest of the EU. However, three of the audited lines (the Eje AtlÃ¡ntico; part of the Madrid â€“ Galicia high-speed line; and the Madrid â€“ Extremadura high-speed line), still use the traditional wider gauge. This impacts performance: the maximum operating speed is limited to 250 km/h (far below the maximum operating speed of 300 km/h for high-speed operations in Spain), and the services are provided either by wide-gauge rolling stock, or by specific variable-gauge trains. These trains need â€œgauge changersâ€: there were 20 such gauge changers in Spain in January 2017. These gauge changers cost up to eight million euro each, and the EU provided 5.4Â million euro in co-financing to support their construction.
Although international agreements have been signed to confirm the political will to establish connections, and although an incentive of 40Â % co-funding is available under the CEF Regulation, Member States do not build high-speed lines if they are not considered a national priority, even if such a line is situated on a transnational corridor and is completing the core network. The Commissionâ€™s mid-term evaluation report on the CEF confirmed this observation.
This limits the European added value of the EU co-funding provided as cross-border links generate the highest European added value. In addition, when links are missing and not built on time, this may have a high cost for society.
The Commission has no power to enforce cross-border projects
Major cross-border high-speed rail projects require particular attention from the EU. They require works to be coordinated closely, so that project outputs become ready for use on a similar schedule and are connected to domestic networks on both sides of the border.
The Commission currently lacks the necessary instruments to intervene effectively if delays on one side of a border hamper the timely use of high-speed rail infrastructure built on the other side of the border. Moreover, the possibilities for all stakeholders to oppose works are manifold, and may cause delays, or even to stop projects previously agreed upon.
There were several examples noted where the outputs created in one Member State will not be effective for at least another two further decades, because of works not having been completed in a neighbouring Member State (see BoxÂ 1).
BoxÂ 1 â€“ Poorly connected national networks, and their impact
Munich-Verona stretch, and the Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT): diverging construction priorities and timescales between Austria, Italy and Germany led to a patchwork of different capacities and potential bottlenecks on the whole Scandinavian-Mediterranean corridor until at least 2040.
To reduce the number of trucks crossing the Alps each day, the EU has been already investing in the BBT, a part of the â€œMunich â€“ Veronaâ€ stretch, since 1986. Austria and Italy have been building the tunnel with 1.58Â billion euro of EU co-funding. 

Source: ECA and Eurostat.
The tunnel works in Austria and Italy will be completed by 2027, but there is little construction activity on the northern access route, which is mostly in Germany. The route has not even been designed yet, and will not be completed before 2035 (Austria), or even 2040 (Germany). Unlike Austria and Italy, Germany sees little interest in destinations such as Innsbruck or Verona, which do not play a key role for Germany for everyday working traffic. As a result, it has not made a priority of constructing the northern access route, even though the route supports the goal of establishing a core network by 2030. This means that it will take more than half a century before the investments are actually used, and that more than 1,5 billion euro is considered largely ineffective for more than two decades.
Portugal-Spain connection (Extremadura)
A high-speed rail connection was planned to connect Lisbon and Madrid. However, it was considered too expensive in times of high government debt. Despite 43Â million euro of EU co-funding already having been paid to Portugal for studies and preparatory works, no high-speed cross-border rail connection is available. The conventional rail line stops in Evora. At the time of the audit, the works on the Portuguese side had started, while the works on the high-speed line on the Spanish side stopped about sixÂ kilometres from the border, as indicated by the arrow in PictureÂ 1.

Even though the policy framework was particularly geared towards completing the core network by 2030, many policy weaknesses remain to be tackled. For example, when assessing the cross-border works for the Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT), we noted the following.
Procurement is a major issue for cross-border TEN-T projects: there are no guidelines on how to reduce inherent procedural risks; there is no single legal framework for cross-border projects; tendering documents, contracts and accounting systems differ, also in their language, for works on Austrian and Italian territory; the procedures for settling disputes are not the same.
There are no simplified procedures to facilitate and accelerate implementation (e.g. â€œone-stop shopsâ€, as already suggested by the Court in Special Report NoÂ 23/2016); there is no single body streamlining the formalities on both sides of the border (e.g. different environmental legislation may apply to rail construction; and the legal response to stakeholdersâ€™ claims may vary).
As most of these constructions are backed up by international agreements between the Member States concerned and the EU, and since the high-speed lines are on international corridors, the progress of works is supervised by EU co-ordinators at corridor level and examined in â€œcorridor forumsâ€. These coordinators have a privileged view of what is, or is not, working along a corridor (and they report regularly on the changes needed), but they also have no legal power.
In addition to lacking coordination of cross-border implementation, a number of other aspects are lacking: (i) there are no â€œsingle-corridor entitiesâ€ to monitor results and impacts on a long term basis for future high-speed rail investments; (ii) there is no time-barring to limit the quantity and duration of legal or administrative action, and no single entity for hearing appeals; and (iii) the assessment of progress of works on a corridor is based on common key performance indicators which are still output-based. As the Court already argued in its special report on maritime transport, the project monitoring of the INEA focuses on construction per se (outputs) and covers neither results nor the use of the lines. Results and impacts are therefore not assessed, and no single body has a view of whether the EU co-funded projects on the core network corridors have achieved any result-based objectives.
Decision-making lacks reliable cost-benefit analyses
â€œVery high-speedâ€ is not needed everywhere
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive: on average, the lines we audited cost 25Â million euro per km (not taking into account the more expensive tunnelling projects), with the overall costs for the BBT as high as 145 million euro per km. Costs are rising over time: the most recent constructions (Milan-Venice and Stuttgart-Munich) are indicating values above 40 million euro per km because of scarcity of land, the crossing of urban nodes, viaducts and extensive tunnelling. However, costs could be lower with little impact on rail operations.
High-speeds are clearly an important characteristic of high-speed rail: they are the factor which allows high-speed rail to compete with air travel and balances the ease of using a private vehicle for the last few miles of a journey. The performance of the high-speed rail system is, however, not only determined by the maximum theoretical speed which can be achieved on a line, but also by the real speed which travellers experience. We therefore analysed the â€œspeed yieldâ€ on the audited high-speed lines, focusing on total travel times and average speeds.
Investment in high-speed lines is only justified if high-speed yields can be achieved: the larger the population base (future demand) and the greater the travel time elasticity and speed yield, the greater the benefits of developing a high-speed line.
This analysis of the speed yields on the lines we audited (AnnexÂ V) indicated that, on average along the course of a line, trains run at only around 45Â % of the lineâ€™s design speed. Only two lines operate at average speeds of more than 200 km/h, and no lines operate at an average speed above 250 km/h. The lowest speed yield on a completed high-speed line is on the Madrid-LeÃ³n high-speed line (39Â % of design speed). The cross-border Figueres-Perpignan section also only operates at 36Â % of its design speed, because it accommodates mixed traffic. Average speed so far below the design speed indicates that an upgraded conventional line would have been enough to achieve the objectives set, at a much lower cost and raises questions as to sound financial management.
A case-by-case approach is therefore needed to decide whether a full very high-speed line is needed. This decision is important, as construction costs are higher when design speeds are higher. Lines with maximum speeds of up to 160Â km/h are at least 5Â % cheaper to build than lines with speeds above that limit. This is because the tracks on higher-speed lines need to be further apart. Up to 160 km/h, the standard spacing is four metres; above that speed, the required line spacing is at least 4.5Â metres. This means that tunnels need to be wider, which is more expensive. 
Also, the cost of a â€œmixedâ€ high-speed line (combined passenger and freight traffic) is higher than for a passenger-only high-speed line, as gradients and curve radiuses make corridor alignments less flexible, and usually these need more land. Maintenance costs for mixed lines will also be higher, as more intensive use is made of the infrastructure.
Mixed traffic lines are more expensive than passenger-only high-speed lines. A study indicated this difference to be up to 5Â %, and up to 13Â % if the passenger-only line is limited to a speed of 250Â km/h (FigureÂ 5).
FigureÂ 5 - Differences in construction costs of high-speed lines

Source: 2009 RAVE Study of 5.8.2009 of the University of Lisbon; comparison with a mixed 350Â km/h high-speed line (100Â baseline).
Choosing the most appropriate option can save millions of euros. For example, on the Munich-Verona stretch, a high-speed line is being built on the audited section of the Brenner Base Tunnel. This is not justified by the speed data: there are currently 13Â stops on the conventional rail line between Munich and Verona with 41Â minutes of stopping time at stations (12.6Â % of total travel time). At present, the journey from Munich to Verona for passengers takes 5Â hours and 24Â minutes. Even if the travel time should come down to around 3.5Â hours once the Brenner high-speed line is completed, the average speed on this line will still be just 115Â km/h, still too low to provide a convincing argument for building a fully-fledged high-speed line.
Cost-efficiency checks are rare
High-speed rail infrastructure is more costly than conventional rail, both to build and to maintain. In given circumstances, however, very high-speed services, operating at 300 km/h or more, may provide limited additional travel time savings, compared to trains running on upgraded conventional lines. Therefore, the option of upgrading existing conventional lines to increase speeds, rather than building a very high-speed line, should also be considered, as it could result in significant cost savings. 
A good practice exists in Italy and Germany: projects for which a preparatory phase has already been launched or legal obligations have arisen are re-assessed before each new programming phase to verify that their features still address current needs. This project review process highlights how design choices lead to substantial savings with limited impact on performance. For example, the project review carried out for the Venice-Trieste section concluded that configuring the line differently could save 5.7Â billion euro but add just 10Â minutes to the trip, i.e. a saving of 570Â million euro for each additional minute of travel time (TableÂ 3).
TableÂ 3 - Cost comparison of high-speed versus conventional rail: Venice â€“ Trieste

This practice applied in Italy and Germany is not used in the other Member States we visited: only the proposed construction of a high-speed line is assessed, and no consideration is made of whether any section, or even the entire line, actually needs to be capable of supporting very high-speed services, or whether an upgrade of the conventional line would also satisfy the specific project objectives.
We also analysed cost-efficiency by assessing the relationship between the investment costs and the real time saved on the audited high-speed lines (TableÂ 4). Our analysis shows that the cost per minute saved is on average 90 million euro per minute of travel time saved, with values ranging from 34.5 million euro (on the Eje AtlÃ¡ntico high-speed line) to 369 million euro (on the Stuttgart-Munich high-speed line).

Cost-benefit analyses are not used as a tool for decision-making in the Member States
As high-speed lines are expensive investments, it is crucial to correctly analyse all major costs and benefits upfront before deciding whether or not to build. When used correctly, cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) make it possible to assess a projectâ€™s social return on investment and its social desirability and usefulness before any decision is taken. Net contributions to social welfare (e.g. through benefit-to-cost ratios exceedingÂ 1, i.e. where benefits exceed costs) under a broad variety of demand (e.g. high versus low traffic growth) and supply scenarios (e.g. high-speed line construction versus upgrade of conventional lines) are needed to support a positive decision.
The Court asked an external expert to make a comparative analysis of the various CBAs linked to the audited high-speed lines. The expert concluded that CBAs are generally used merely as a compulsory administrative step, rather than as a tool for better decision-making and stakeholder inclusion. We found the following examples noteworthy.
A CBA with a negative economic net present value was accepted for EU co-funding of project No 2007-FR-24070-P (concerning the East Section of the Rhin â€“ RhÃ´ne high-speed line) in France. For another French high-speed rail project (project No 2010-FR-92204-P, concerning the upgrade of the existing line between Mulhouse and the border to allow operations of high-speed trains and intercity express) no CBA had been performed, but the project did receive EU funding.
No CBAs had been carried out when the decision was made to build the Halle/Leipzigâ€“Erfurtâ€“Ebensfeld and Stuttgart-Wendlingen-Ulm sections in Germany. The decision to build them was political, and a CBA was only made at a later stage (ex post) to demonstrate socio-economic profitability.
Most studies in Spain, irrespective of the region and project characteristics, showed very similar results and a relatively low benefit-to-cost ratio (of around one). In reality, some projects have only a limited chance of viability from a social cost-benefit perspective (for example, the â€œVenta de BaÃ±os â€“ LeÃ³nâ€ high-speed rail section was non-viable from a socio-economic perspective across various sensitivity scenarios), but they are being built nevertheless.
Since 2007, no update has been made to the Brenner axis CBA. In the 2007 analysis, the cost-benefit factor was 1.9. In the meantime, the planning and construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel project has already been delayed by around eleven years: its completion was initially expected by 2016, but now it is not expected until 2027. Most recent data reveals that the projected cost for the tunnel will be around 9.3 billion euro (taking into account the inflation rate). Between the preliminary estimates of 2002 and the estimate of 2013, costs increased by 46Â % (from 5.9 billion euro to 8.6 billion euro), and freight traffic is now projected to decrease. These factors reduce the benefit-to-cost ratio very strongly, and makes the 2007 CBA data on passenger numbers and freight traffic unrealistic. This was not questioned by the INEA, which is managing this on behalf of the Commission. 
For the 2015 CEF calls for proposals, the INEA introduced a specific assessment of costs and benefits before agreeing to provide CEF support. We consider that this will help to improve the quality of decision-making upfront. However, the INEA (as well as the Managing Authorities in case of cohesion policy expenditure under shared management) is currently not assessing the cost per minute saved, or the cost of upgrading the existing conventional rail line as alternative to the proposed new high-speed line before agreeing to spend EU co-funding.
Cost overruns, construction delays and delayed entry into service: a norm instead of an exception
The EU budget does not suffer from cost overruns for high-speed rail investments, as the co-funded amount is capped at the initially agreed amount. Although cost overruns are borne by national budgets, we assessed the extent of cost overruns and delays, both at project and at line level. Based on the data available to us, we estimate that aggregate cost overrun at 5.7Â billion euro at project level, and 25.1Â billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). 
Three projects out of 30 assessed had significant cost overruns of more than 20Â % of the initial estimates and all audited high-speed lines had cost overruns of more than 25 % (TableÂ 5). The German lines had the highest cost overruns: the cost overrun of the Stuttgart-Munich line reached 622.1Â %. 
TableÂ 5 - Overview of costs per km and comparison with estimates

*No cost estimates available at line level, so impossible to estimate potential overruns.

Delays at project level were also significant: eight of the 30 projects we audited had been delayed by at least one year, and half of the lines (five lines out of the ten audited) had experienced delays of more than one decade. The Milan-Venice line is forecast to have the longest delay compared to initial estimates (18Â years).
The highest project cost overrun was 83Â %, for the â€œStuttgartÂ 21â€ station (PictureÂ 2), which received 726.6Â million euro in grants from the EU. 
PictureÂ 2 - Construction works on the StuttgartÂ 21 station

For this project, because of unrealistic initial cost estimates for tunnelling in a densely populated city centre, and insufficient assessments of geological, environmental and local community cultural heritage aspects, construction costs have soared. The total construction costs of 4.5Â billion euro estimated in 2003 has been increased to 6.5Â billion euro in 2013 and to 8.2Â billion euro (latest estimate available in January 2018). This means that there is a difference of 3.7Â billion euro from the original agreement. So far, all funding partners have refused to cover more than the costs set in the original funding agreement. 
There will also be a significant delay in completing the works for this station, as it was originally planned that the construction works would be completed by 2008. The start was already delayed from 2001 to 2009, and current estimations are that the works will be completed by 2025. 
Finally, for 18 projects, we also assessed how long it took for the lines to actually enter into service once the EU co-funded works had been completed. For six projects, entry into operations happened not later than one month after the end of construction works. For two projects, entry into service had been delayed by around one year; for six projects, the delay was two years; for another, the delay was four years; while two projects in Germany will be delayed by eight years (these projects were finished by the end of 2015, and it is currently estimated that the line will not be in operation before the end of 2023). In one other case (the Figueres â€“ Perpignan cross-border line between Spain and France), even though the whole line was finished, it could not be used until 22Â months later since it was not connected to the rest of the network on both ends. 
A citizenâ€™s view: a real-life assessment of travel times, prices and connections, of passenger-services and of stations and their catchment area
Travel times and ticket prices, are important factors for success
We examined the competitiveness of high-speed rail by asking a travel agent to research the cheapest return ticket prices, travel times and number of connections on given days for both business and tourist profiles on the audited lines. A summary of our methodology and the relevant data are in AnnexÂ VI. This allowed us to calculate average prices per kilometre and minute of travel. 
Ticket prices may vary widely (e.g. according to the time of day, and the availability of special offers). However, this work was done on a sufficient scale (data on more than 5Â 000Â return trips was collected) to allow us to realistically assess the options for travelling between the origin and destination pairs on the audited lines. The following messages came out of this analysis.
On speed: High-speed rail is often much faster (on average 30Â % to 50Â % of travel time) than conventional rail. Air travel (from take-off to landing) is faster than high-speed rail. However, when assessing real total travel time from city centre to city centre, including the travel to the airport and boarding procedures, high-speed rail is often competitive.
On ticket prices: High-speed rail is often much cheaper than air travel. Last-minute bookings for both transport modes are more expensive than tickets booked in advance. In Germany, ticket prices on the Stuttgart-Munich high-speed line are lower than conventional rail ticket prices.
The number of high-speed rail services offered varies considerably during the year. The availability of connections is important: some high-speed lines have a large number of connections (e.g. 50-60 per day in Germany), while two of the four audited lines in Spain (Madrid-Santiago and Madrid-LeÃ³n) and the two audited French lines had very few connections. 
Some of the audited routes are not practicable by conventional rail; for example, travelling from Rome to Turin by conventional rail takes over 20Â hours. High-speed rail takes half as long, and air travel one-tenth as long. The situation is similar on the Madrid-Santiago line. 
The most successful connections in terms of business users (e.g. Madrid-Barcelona; Turin-Rome; Paris-Strasbourg) are also the most expensive. Overall, high-speed rail in France costs most per kilometre travelled (for business and leisure).
To assess how competitive high-speed rail really is, total travel time from city centre to city centre and the prices of the available options were analysed. We further refined our data analysis for four lines, and calculated the relevant figures, comparing high-speed rail, conventional rail, air and road, thus including the cost of private cars and long-distance coaches (TableÂ 6).
Table 6 - Door-to-door travel analysis on selected high-speed lines
Source: ECA.
The â€œcity centre to city centreâ€ analysis told us the following:
Between Madrid and Barcelona, the high-speed rail connection is the fastest travel option: even air travel takes longer from door to door, and is more expensive. This explains why high-speed rail has increased its market share considerably on this line in recent years. In fact, since its opening in 2008, the modal split between air and rail has changed from 85:15 to 38:62 in 2016. Such analysis can be used to assess the success of high-speed rail operations and measure the degree of sustainability of the investments made. 
Between Rome and Milan, air and high-speed rail also lead the field in terms of travelling time. The number of trains increased and ticket prices reduced over time. High-speed rail is therefore taking a larger market share over time, also at the expense of long-distance conventional rail.
It is possible to travel by conventional rail from Berlin to Munich, but it involves many changes. Air travel is fastest, but expensive. High-speed rail is the second-fastest option, and it is cheaper. While coach travel is cheapest, the journey time is dissuasive. 
From Paris to Strasbourg, there are no air or direct conventional rail connections. High-speed rail has the fastest total travel time, but ticket prices are much higher than travelling by car or coach. 
Our overall conclusion is that total travel time and price level are both important factors for success. Combined with an effectively regular service (frequent trains which depart and arrive on time), these factors could contribute to strengthen future high-speed rail operations.
Further improvements needed to rail ticketing, and in monitoring passenger-services data
Published research on high-speed rail suggests that ticketing flexibility and punctuality enhance intermodal competitiveness and promote sustainable success. These could be developed further.
Rail ticketing compares poorly with that of the airline industry. For example, single e-ticketing solutions, such as those allowing booking trips involving more than one operator or crossing borders, are much easier for air travel than for rail. There is also almost no search engine available for combined air/high-speed rail travel.
The Commission has started to collect service-related data and indicators on the developments in the use of rail networks, and on the evolution of framework conditions through its Rail Market Monitoring Scheme (RMMS) platform. However, this data has been inconsistent up to now, as common standards were not comprehensively applied until the end of 2017. Moreover, only a limited set of data is currently collected in respect of high-speed rail as opposed to conventional rail; it covers the areas of infrastructure charging, capacity allocation, infrastructure investment and public-service obligations covering high-speed rail.
Until 2017, there were no agreed common definitions of punctuality. Punctuality data therefore varies greatly within the EU. Rail operators are obliged to post the reports on punctuality and customer satisfaction on the ERADIS database as required by ArticleÂ 28(2) of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1371/2007 but, as there is no common methodology or standardised framework for these reports, they are hard to use and do not provide travellers with a clear overview of the situation. The Commission has commissioned Eurobarometer surveys to monitor passenger satisfaction with rail services. The last survey was published in 2013, and a follow-up report is expected by the end of June 2018. Significant progress is still needed in monitoring these issues at the EU level.
The number and location of stations are both important
Having the right number of stations is vital to a lineâ€™s success and to its operational sustainability. If a line has very few or no intermediate stops, the overall speed between origin and destination is high, and competitiveness with other modes of transport is optimal; however, this is detrimental to sustainability, as fewer potential passengers living along the line can use it. In contrast, if there are more stops on a line, its average speed is lower, and competitiveness with other modes of transport is at stake, but more passengers can board, increasing ticket income. 
We analysed the number of stops on the audited lines and the resulting impact on travel times and the competitiveness of services on the line, as well as their accessibility, connectivity and regeneration effects. The full information and all key data on this station analysis is in AnnexÂ VII.
Data from official timetables shows that each intermediate stop extends total travel time by an average of four to 12Â minutes, and reduces average speed by three to 16Â km/h. The number of stations ranges from four (LGV Rhin-RhÃ´ne) to 15 (on the Berlin-Munich line) and the distances between them vary greatly (the longest distance between two stations on the same high-speed line is 253Â km; the shortest is 26Â km). Different types of services run on the audited lines (for example, on the Madrid-Barcelona line, some trains run a â€œnon-stopâ€ service over 621Â km, whereas other trains on the line also serve intermediate stations, with varying frequency). The largest time difference between the most direct and least direct train services is 72Â minutes (on the Berlin-Munich line).
To assess the potential number of users of a high-speed line, we also examined the catchment areas of each of the ten high-speed lines and four cross-border lines in the audit. Some stations do not have sufficient numbers of passengers in their immediate catchment areas, and are located too close to each other. This reduces the overall effectiveness of high-speed services, because they must stop too often without reaching many new passengers, or it makes daily train management overly complicated to ensure acceptable ridership figures.
AnnexÂ VIII contains overall results and key data on the stations of all the audited high-speed lines. For example, as shown in FigureÂ 6, although the Madrid-Barcelona-French border line has a very large catchment area (which explains its success), the catchment area of some stations on the line (e.g. Guadalajara-Yebes or Calatayud) is extremely small. Given the very limited number of people living within the 15-minute catchment area, there is reason to doubt the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of keeping these stations as stops on the high-speed line (the 100Â % 60-minute catchment area overlap for Guadalajara station is because of its proximity to Madrid).

While the Commissionâ€™s plan is to connect all core network airports to the rail network by 2050, preferably by high-speed rail, only a few high-speed rail stations currently have a direct high-speed connection to an airport. High-speed rail and air can be complementary (by delivering passengers to an airport, high-speed rail can enlarge the airportâ€™s catchment area, and air passengers may decide to use a given airport because of a seamless and fast rail connection after landing). However, we found that it is complicated for passengers to combine high-speed rail and air travel. For example, even though the Madrid â€“ Barcelona high-speed line passes close to Spainâ€™s two busiest airports (Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat, which were used by 50.4Â million and 44.2Â million passengers respectively in 2016), there are no plans to connect them by high-speed services to the high-speed rail network.
To be successful and competitive, high-speed rail stations should be well located. 
They should be easily accessible to travellers by many modes of transport, including walking and cycling, and offer suitable public transport facilities and parking spaces at affordable prices. 
They should offer multiple well-functioning high-speed rail connections, as well as a sufficient number of trains throughout the day.
They should contribute to economic activity in the surrounding area (the â€œregenerationâ€ or â€œre-urbanisationâ€ effect).
We analysed the accessibility, connectivity and regeneration effects of 18Â high-speed rail stations (two per audited line). The full information, including the quantitative criteria used, is in Annex IX. Our analysis indicates that access to 14 stations could be improved. For example, the Meuse TGV station (Picture 3) on the LGV Est-EuropÃ©enne is poorly accessible: as the arrow shows, the station is in an isolated location in the countryside. A few local bus lines, and a small car park for private cars, provide the only means of reaching the station. 
PictureÂ 3 - The Meuse TGV station

We also found that seven stations were not appropriately sized: four were too big, and three were too small for the number of passengers. Four stations did not provide general services to the public. Five stations were not well connected, while another seven could benefit from improved connections.
By analysing changes over time (for example, in the job market, the property market, and the number of businesses attracted and jobs created), we saw no clear regeneration effects from 15 of the 18Â stations on the audited high-speed lines. The opening of the Belfort-MontbÃ©liard station on the Rhin-RhÃ´ne line had encouraged shops and a hotel to open nearby, and allowed a regional hospital to be relocated. In two other cases, upgrade works in the stations â€“ linked to the arrival of high-speed services â€“ created easier connections between neighbourhoods which were previously separated by rail tracks. This indicates that high-speed lines may accompany and support economic improvements already started and anticipated by the region, but it will not, on its own, cause a local economic boom. 
High-speed rail sustainability: effectiveness of the EU co-funding at risk

If a high-speed line is to be successful and the investment sustainable, it should be able to carry a high number of passengers. We assessed this element in two ways: by benchmarking the passenger numbers carried over time, and by analysing the number of people living in the catchment area along the line.
Passenger data analysis: three of the seven completed high-speed rail lines carry fewer passengers than the benchmark of nine million per year
Judging by a benchmark arising from academic and institutional sources, a high-speed line should ideally have nineÂ million passengers, or at least sixÂ million in the opening year to be successful. In 2016, only three lines actually carried more than nineÂ million passengers per year (Madrid-Barcelona, Turin-Salerno and LGV Est-EuropÃ©enne). On three of the seven completed high-speed lines we audited (Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Rhin-RhÃ´ne and Madrid-LeÃ³n), the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6Â billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7Â billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines. 
Catchment-area analysis of the number of people living along the lines: nine of 14 audited high-speed lines and stretches do not have sufficient high number of potential passengers
We also performed a catchment area analysis to assess the potential sustainability of operations at line level (see FigureÂ 7). AnnexÂ VIII also contains overall results and key data for all of the audited high-speed lines.
FigureÂ 7 - Catchment area analysis of the Madrid-Barcelona-French border high-speed line

Source: ECA and Eurostat.
Nine of the 14Â audited high-speed lines and cross-border connections did not have a sufficiently high number of passengers in their fifteen- and thirty-minute catchment areas along the line to make high-speed rail successful. These were the Madrid-LeÃ³n, Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Madrid-Galicia, Milano-Venezia, Rhin-RhÃ´ne, Stuttgart-Munich, Munich-Verona, Figueres-Perpignan and Basque Y lines. It is useful to note that the three lines which did not meet the passenger benchmark (see above) are also included in this criteria. 
We also analysed success of high-speed rail in a global context, to understand the reasons for success (Box 2).


Box 2 - The operations of the Shinkansen
The Shinkansen train (Picture 4) and high-speed rail operations in Japan, allow us to make a wider comparison of high-speed rail operations on a global scale. 
The 550Â km high-speed line from Tokyo to Osaka is very successful, carrying 163Â million passengers per year. There are many reasons for this success: the line connects megacities with populations of several million; trains run on dedicated tracks at a very high frequency (up to 433 trains per day); service reliability and punctuality are outstanding (in 2016, the average delay was less than 24 seconds throughout the year); and there are state-of-the-art safety and security measures in the stations and along the line, as well as sufficient support to travellers in stations.

The competitiveness of high-speed rail compared to other modes of transport: there is no â€œpolluter-paysâ€ principle yet
High-speed rail has only a limited competitive edge. Whereas the Japanese Shinkansen remains competitive even over travel distances of more than 900Â km, high-speed rail in Europe is generally competitive over travel distances of between 200 and 500Â km, with journeys lasting up to four hours. The car is the dominant transport mode on journeys of less than 200Â km because of its flexibility in the final mile, while air transport is most competitive for longer journeys.
A carbon-based taxation system is a tool to consider the impact on the environment of the different transport modes. Currently, there is no operational arrangement within any EU Member State comparable to Switzerlandâ€™s dedicated Railway Infrastructure Fund, which is part-financed from taxes imposed on lorries transiting the country. Switzerlandâ€™s approach reduces the financial burden on taxpayers for building and maintaining the railway network, since it directly channels tax income levied on one transport mode to investment support for another.
There is currently no charging system in the EU that looks at both user-pays and polluter-pays principles across the various transport modes, so as to enhance the competitiveness of rail. There have been attempts in the past to change intermodal conditions by internalising external costs from various modes of transport, but these were largely unsuccessful. The topic of taxation as a function of greenhouse-gas emissions nevertheless remains on the agenda of many governments. For example, the introduction of a cross-funding scheme is currently debated (again) in France while, in 2018, Italy will fund the Brenner Base Tunnel construction and its southern access lines with proceeds from a dedicated fund, created in 1997, from highway toll revenues.
Seamless and competitive cross-border high-speed rail operations: not yet universal
With many barriers still existing, there is a long way to go before markets become open and competitive on high-speed lines in the EU
Effective competition on high-speed lines can demonstrably improve services and reduce prices for travellers in the EU. There are currently very few cases where there is effective on-track competition on high-speed lines (there is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria). The introduction of competition on the Italian Turin-Salerno high-speed line brought better services for travellers. There are more trains to choose from (the new entrant operates 34Â daily connections in each direction in the 2017-2018Â timetable), and ticket prices have fallen by at least 24Â %. ERA staff we interviewed reported a similar positive effect for Austria: competition between the incumbent rail firm and a new entrant had brought more customers, also for the incumbent rail operator.
However, in France and Spain, the market for high-speed rail services was still not open, and there was no on-track competition on high-speed lines. These Member States wish to wait until after 2020 to assess whether the incumbent rail operator is ready for competition on long-distance passenger services. Even after that point, if the lines are deemed to operate as public-service obligations, these Member States will be able to grant a 10-year postponement under certain conditions, meaning that truly open competition may be deferred as far as 2035.
Alongside the phased opening of the market set out in the Fourth Railway Package, a number of practices persist within the rail industry which prevent a truly seamless EU high-speed rail network from becoming a reality, and potentially preventing new foreign entrants from competing on high-speed lines. These practices include technical and administrative barriers, and other hindrances to interoperability. What this means in practice for travellers is explained in BoxÂ 3.
BoxÂ 3 â€“ The impact for travellers when there is no seamless travel of trains crossing borders
The missing interoperability on the Munich-Verona stretch causes a stop and delays at the Brenner station
There are over 11Â 000 national rules in rail, which the ERA is currently categorising with a view to â€œcleaning them upâ€ at a later stage. There are no common rules for cross-border rail transport. Germany and Austria have a harmonised approach, but Italy continues to apply a different set of rules. All this results in an obligatory layover at the Austrian/Italian border: all trains must stop at the border to make the operational changes required by Italian and Austrian national legislation, which impose varying requirements. Passenger trains must stop for at least 14Â minutes (PictureÂ 5), while goods trains are delayed for 45Â minutes. Such delays are very significant, considering that the multi-billion infrastructure investment on the Munich-Verona high-speed line has an overall time-gain target of 114Â minutes.
PictureÂ 5 - Passengers waiting at Brenner station to continue their journey

This problem was already highlighted in the Courtâ€™s Special Report NoÂ 8/2010. Eight years later, our recommendations have not led to any changes in practice. The national authorities in the visited Member States told us that cross-border problems caused by varying national rules on employment or working languages could best be solved by the introduction of harmonised rules across the EU. Air transport, for example, uses only one working language (English); this helps to reduce barriers between continents, and could resolve similar issues between Member States.
The missing infrastructure links between France and Spain (Atlantic cross-border route) oblige passengers to change trains and platforms 
Because most of the section between Bordeaux and the Spanish border is not a priority for France, infrastructure at the border remains antiquated, incompatible and poorly suited to a modern high-speed rail network. France is not ready to invest in this infrastructure (therefore does not ask for EU funding), and this will negatively effect on Spain and Portugalâ€™s connections to the EU network along the Atlantic corridor. On the Spanish side of the border, works to connect the Basque high-speed rail network to the rest of the Spanish network are ongoing (with 318 million euros of EU co-funding). The result is that all passengers currently must change platforms and trains to cross the border (PictureÂ 6).

Track access charges: overly complicated, and a potential hindrance to competition
Under the EU legal framework for rail operations, an infrastructure manager (a separate entity from the rail operator) must allow any operator to use the rail tracks if they contribute to the costs of maintaining them. These track access charges have different impacts on the sustainability of the network. Depending on the level they are set at, they can help to recover a share of the infrastructure investment costs, and if they are set low enough, they may also encourage on-track competition by allowing new market entrants to participate.
Directive (EU) NoÂ 2012/34/EU requires track access charges to be set primarily on the basis of the costs directly incurred as a result of operating the train service. But the principles used to determine pricing across Member States differ significantly, mainly because the legislation allows many parameters to be used. In all visited Member States, â€œmark-upsâ€ had been applied to take into account specific cost categories, such as the time of day of the requested slot or the presence, or absence, of a bottleneck. 
The International Union of Railways has reported that track access charges are not calculated transparently. They regularly change, and are subject to no less than 56Â variables, leading to very different outcomes. This is confirmed by FigureÂ 8, which shows the exact level of track access charges on selected EU origin-destination pairs connected by high-speed rail, demonstrating that charging levels are indeed very different. For example, track access charges are very high in France, and much lower in Italy.
FigureÂ 8 - Track access charge levels for selected origin-destination pairs in the EU

Getting the level of track access charges right is important to ensure both sustainability and competitiveness. 
In France, track access charges are kept high to provide income to the infrastructure manager, and to ensure the sustainability of operations of the infrastructure manager, which has significant debts. This reduces the need for the state to fund and maintain new high-speed rail infrastructure. At the same time, excessively high track access charges discourage new entrants from entering the market, thus shielding the incumbent rail operator from competition.
In Italy, track access charges were previously used as a means of increasing competition between the established rail operator and the new entrant. In addition to other measures (such as ensuring the right of access to station services), the Italian rail regulator lowered the charges to ensure fair competition. This improved the situation for travellers (see paragraph 85)
A strong and independent regulator: necessary, but not always a reality
This trade-off between financial sustainability and competitiveness is crucial. It is therefore important that national regulators are in place in each Member State to act, and that the Commission supervises the system. These bodies should ensure that rules governing the use of mark-ups to recover the full costs of infrastructure are applied correctly, the legal objective being the best use of the available infrastructure.
Under EU law, national rail regulatory bodies must be given extensive independence and powers to monitor railway markets to ensure that newcomers are not discriminated against, so that fair competition can develop. They should be endowed with sufficient resources. The Commission follows up on these requirements, and supports national watchdogs in their activities, and facilitates dialogue and the exchange of best practices between regulatory bodies. We observed the following two issues.
Spain is the only Member State that considers track access charges to constitute taxes, and sets them in law. This limits the management independence of the infrastructure manager and the powers of the regulator to modify them in case of non-compliance with the rules. In addition, it limits the time available to revise charges, and complicates revisions and complaints. The regulatorâ€™s position is a difficult one, because it has limited staffing and because, contrary to the provisions of the Recast Directive, its decisions are not binding on the infrastructure manager.
In France, in 2017, the regulator issued a binding negative opinion on a new model for calculating track access charges which was planned for 2018. The French government intervened by setting the level of access charges for 2018 by decree, keeping them in line with the originally applicable model. Such an approach effectively limits the power of the regulatory authority.
The Commission took action in these two cases by launching infringement proceedings. It closely monitors ongoing legislative initiatives to ensure that powers of the regulators are not eroded in the process.
Conclusions and recommendations
High-speed rail operations have many advantages but there is no realistic long term EU plan, and there is no truly EU high-speed network
High-speed rail supports the EUâ€™s sustainable mobility policy objectives, because its carbon footprint is lower than other forms of transport. It has many other benefits, such as increased safety levels; it relieves pressure on congested road networks; it allows both business and leisure passengers to travel quickly and in comfort, and it can provide socio-economic support to regions.
The Commissionâ€™s target of tripling the length of the high-speed rail network (reaching more than 30Â 000Â km in 2030) is not supported by credible analysis. We consider it unlikely that this target will be reached, because it takes around 16Â years for high-speed rail infrastructure to be planned, built, and to begin operations. By the end of 2017, only 9Â 000Â km of high-speed lines were in operation, with another 1Â 700Â km in construction.
There is no genuine European high-speed rail network: there is only a patchwork of national high-speed lines. The Commission has no power to decide if and when high-speed lines detailed in the TEN-T Regulation should be built, as decisions to build high-speed rail lines are the sole responsibility of Member States. Completing the EUâ€™s transnational corridors by linking national networks is not a priority for the Member States audited. Although an EU funding mechanism was adopted at the same time (the CEF Regulation), and although various international agreements have been signed by the Member States concerned, high-speed rail border crossing works are not being completed in a coordinated fashion. This leads to a low European added value of the EU co-funding going to high-speed rail infrastructure investments in the Member States (paragraphs 21 to 36).
The principles of sound financial management have not consistently been applied for the audited high-speed rail infrastructure investments
The quality of the assessment of needs in the Member States is low. Alternative solutions, such as upgrading existing conventional lines instead of building new high-speed lines, are only considered systematically in Italy and Germany; this is a good practice which should be followed universally. Decisions to build are national and political; they are rarely based on proper cost-benefit analyses.
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive, and is becoming more so: the lines we audited cost, on average, 25 million euros per kilometre. Cost-efficiency is low. While the EU budget does not suffer from cost overruns for high-speed rail investments, as the co-funded amount is capped at the initially agreed amount and any cost increase is borne by national budgets, cost overruns and delays in construction of the lines audited were the norm, and it takes a long time for lines to enter into service once built. Aggregate cost overruns are 5.7 billion euro at project level, and 25,1 billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). Delays were also significant with half of the lines facing delays of more than a decade. Our speed-yield assessment clearly indicates that very high-speed rail services are not always needed: in most cases, only around 45Â % of the design speed is achieved on average. Only two high-speed lines have average operating speeds above 200 km/h and none have speeds above 250 km/h. Our findings indicate that four of the ten lines will cost more than 100 million euros per travel minute saved. Paying careful attention to the elements above could save hundreds of millions of euros, and ensure that high-speed built lines are used well (paragraph 37 to 57).
Assessing the situation for the EU citizens highlights the advantages of high-speed rail, while the sustainability of the EU co-funding to high-speed lines is at risk
The assessment of travel times, prices and number of connections indicates that high-speed rail has advantages over its competitors (air transport, conventional rail and road transport). Our overall conclusion is that total travel time and price level are equally important factors for success. Combined with regular service (frequent trains) and reliability (punctual departures and arrivals), these factors could allow high-speed rail to increase its market share. The number of stations on a line is important, and their location vital: not all stations audited are well accessible and have good connections, and for 15 of the 18 audited high-speed rail stations we saw no clear regeneration effects in the surrounding area.
We assess that sustainability is at risk: judging by a benchmark of nine million passengers per year, three of the seven completed lines audited cannot be considered successful high-speed rail lines (Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Rhin-RhÃ´ne and Madrid-LeÃ³n) since the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6 billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7 billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines, which could have been mitigated by a sound ex ante assessment of costs and benefits for the individual lines.
Our assessment of the number of people living in the catchment area of the audited lines indicates that 9 of the 14 audited lines and cross-border connections did not have enough potential passengers to be successful. In addition, high-speed rail and other transport modes do not compete equally as not all modes of transport are subject to the same charges (paragraph 58 to 85).
Seamless and competitive cross-border high-speed rail operations are still some way off
There are still many technical, administrative and other barriers to interoperability, even though the Court called for urgent action to lift such barriers in a special report published in 2010. The rail passenger market is not open in France and Spain, although there is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria. In Germany, the rail passenger market is open, but there is no competition on high-speed lines. With the current rules, competition may be delayed until as long as 2035. As competition encourages better services, more frequent trains and lower prices for travellers, it should materialise sooner.
Track access charges aim to recover previous infrastructure investment and operating costs. If they are set low enough to allow new entrants to participate in the market, they can incentivise on-track competition. However, the systems used to calculate them are overly complicated, as numerous variables can be applied. 
Each Member State must have a regulatory body, which must be qualified, adequately staffed and independent from the entity fixing the charges and from the government. This regulator must apply the rules strictly to ensure that agreed policies are respected. In two of the four cases we assessed, we found evidence that the regulators cannot exercise their statutory duties. The Commission acted upon these two cases by launching infringement procedures (paragraph 86 to 95).
Recommendation 1 â€“ The planning of the EU high-speed rail network
The Commission should, in its supervisory role, take the following steps:
1. Based on the inputs and commitments of the Member States, it should adopt a realistic long-term deployment plan for building the remaining infrastructure needed to complete the core EU high-speed rail network in the context of the revision of the TEN-T Regulation. This long-term planning should be based on the key enforceable strategic infrastructure projects on the core network, with particular focus on cross-border sections, which must be completed by 2030 to enhance European added value.
Based on the enforceable strategic plan under 1, it should take the foreseen remedial actions if projects on these priority stretches do not begin according to the agreed timeline, if they are delayed, or if coordination problems along the various borders seem likely to prevent the line from entering into service as planned.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals for TEN-Â T.
2. It should link EU co-funding to an assessment of the need for very high-speed lines, and to closer monitoring and supervision by providing specific conditions spelled out in implementing decisions on key priority stretches. In addition, the role of European Coordinators in facilitating the implementation of cross-border projects should be strengthened, as should the connection between the core network corridor work plans and the implementation of the CEF.
Target implementation date: immediately.

Recommendation 2 â€“ EU co-funding support for high-speed rail infrastructure investments
The Commission should :
1. Revise the TEN-T regulation to enable it to enforce the timely implementation of the key strategic infrastructure networks identified above. 
Target implementation date: initiate the work as soon as possible to ensure work is completed by 2023.
2. Upon revision of the TEN-T Regulation earmark the EU co-funding support for these strategic priority projects.
Target implementation date: immediately after the revision of the TEN-T Regulation.
3.During the programming of cohesion policy, together with the Member States, focus its funding for high-speed rail lines to those high-speed rail lines that form part of the core network corridors.
Target implementation date: when preparing the programmes for the post-2020 period.
4. Make EU co-funding contingent on the introduction of an effective on-track competition on the supported high-speed lines soonest after completion of the works.
Target implementation date: immediately.
5. Link EU co-funding to beneficiaries not only to the delivery of outputs but also to the achievement of results announced. To achieve this, it should ensure the introduction of the principle of paying a fixed percentage of the EU co-funding granted to the beneficiary as a performance bonus, if it can be evidenced, from an ex-post evaluation, that the anticipated results have been exceeded. Such bonus should come from a performance reserve, similar to what currently exists in the Cohesion policy framework.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals for the post-2020 period.
6. In the upcoming CEF Regulation, together with the Member States, agree stronger enforcement tools to speed up the completion of the current obligations deriving from the TEN-T regulation.
Such enforcement tools should also tackle the situation where a Member State does not propose to timely advance on key projects in view of fulfilling the commitments taken for the completion of the core network projects.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals on CEF for the post-2020 period.

Recommendation 3 - Simplifying cross-border constructions
To simplify current and future major cross-border investments in high-speed rail infrastructure, the Commission should:
1. Review the rules on procurement, to have the option of a single legal framework for key cross-border infrastructure projects. This includes issues such as the language of the tendering documents, contracts and accounting systems of management bodies implementing the projects, and procedures for the settling of disputes.
2. Create, or facilitate the creation of, â€œone-stop shopsâ€, which are single bodies streamlining the various formalities to be complied with on both sides of the border.
3. Accelerate the lifting of all administrative and regulatory barriers to interoperability.
Target implementation date: by mid-2019.


Recommendation 4 â€“ Actions to improve high-speed rail operations for passengers
The Commission should:
1. Provide support to the rail sector to actively develop single e-ticketing solutions, including for high-speed rail operations.
2. Monitor Member States to ensure that they take all possible measures to implement EU rules for calculating track access charges fully and correctly, in particular in respect of the obligation to coordinate mark-ups to facilitate cross-border high-speed rail operations.
3. In its supervisory role, hold Member States to their obligations to guarantee that market access conditions for high-speed rail are supervised by independent bodies and that infrastructure managers coordinate to ensure the optimum effective use of such routes.
4. Improve the information for citizens (i) with regard to punctuality data by developing specific indicators for high-speed rail and (ii) on the basis of data already available in Commission databases (ERADIS), with regard to information on customer service satisfaction, by developing a standard reporting framework and methodology. The data and results are to be disseminated in its two-yearly Rail Market Monitoring Report.
5. Strengthen intermodal competition by setting out principles requiring the external costs of all transport modes to be adequately considered, and advocating their implementation.
Target implementation date: by the end of 2019.

This Report was adopted by Chamber II, headed by Mrs Iliana IVANOVA, Member of the Court of Auditors, in Luxembourg at its meeting of 13 June 2018.

Annex vi
A citizenâ€™s view: Assessment of travel times, prices and connections on the audited high-speed rail lines: the methodology and the data

Data collection methodology applied:
The work consisted of collecting ticket prices and travel data applicable on given dates for the origins and destinations of the audited HSL, using the transport modes of HSR, conventional rail and air, and analyzing any particular patterns discovered on the following routes. 

The first part of the work consisted of data gathering to obtain information and data on the lowest ticket price (including taxes) for buying a ticket for the day concerned, and in the most logical moment of the day for the travel community concerned, while the second part was about noting the number of travel connections between the two stations that day (indicating if there are less than 10, between 10 and 20, or over 20Â possible connections). The detailed scope of work was as follows: 
Number of different types of transportation: 3: High-speed train, Conventional train and Air (long distance coaches analysed by ECA separately);
Number of destinations / routes: 9 as indicated above;
Number of directions (every route is bi-directional; e.g. MAD-BCN and BCN-MAD): 2 but limited to origin and destination points;
Number of different starting days in week: 2 (a return ticket from Monday to Wednesday attracting usually business clients; a return ticket from Friday to Sunday, attracting usually leisure passengers);
Travel dates: 4Â weeks with approximate dates (5 to 9Â JuneÂ 2017; 3 to 7Â JulyÂ 2017; 31Â July to 4Â AugustÂ 2017, and 28Â August to 3Â SeptemberÂ 2017);
Travel times in combination with the above travel days: (Business travel: departure between 7 and 9Â AM and return between 4 and 6Â PM; Leisure travel: departure between 10 to 12Â AM and return between 5 to 7Â PM);
Number of booking times: 3 (3Â months in advance of the first day of the travel; 2 weeks in advance of the first day of the travel; â€œLast minuteâ€: the working day before the first day of travel);
The data to be gathered: Date of departure and arrival; Price in euro of the return ticket; Duration of the trip in minutes. Number of daily connections.
The data gathering work started in March 2017 to accomplish the â€˜3Â months in advanceâ€™ booking of the travel during the first date mentioned above. Priority was given on time over money for business travel trips, and money over time for leisure trips. The logic applied when booking a ticket has been i.e. if two options within the agreed timeframe are available for business traveler and one is 20Â euros cheaper but 30Â minutes slower, priority will be given to the fastest and slightly more expensive train. The same will be applicable for leisure travel: if a train is 30Â minutes longer on the way but is 20Â euros cheaper, this train will have to be selected.

Executive summary
About Erasmus+
Erasmus+ (â€œthe Programmeâ€) is an EU programme supporting actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport with a total budget of â‚¬16.45 billion for the period 2014-2020. Its aim is to provide learners and staff with the opportunity to gain skills and undergo personal, socio-educational and professional development through study, training, work experience or volunteering abroad. It also aims to improve quality and foster innovation, excellence and internationalisation in organisations working in these three fields.
A higher level objective of Erasmus+ is to help European countries to modernise and improve their education and training systems, reinforcing their role as drivers for growth, employment, competitiveness, innovation and social cohesion.
Erasmus+ covers Higher Education (HE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), School Education (SE), Adult Education, Youth and Sport. The activities and projects that can be funded under Erasmus+ are distributed between Key Actions (KA). The Programme is mostly (80Â %) implemented under indirect management by National Agencies (NA).
What we audited
We assessed the performance and European Added Value (EAV) of the Programme, focusing on KA1, Learning Mobility of individuals (â€œErasmus+ Mobilityâ€ or â€œMobilityâ€) as regards Education and Training, which represents more than half of the Programmeâ€™s budget allocation for the period 2014-2020. By January 2018 more than 2.3 million learners and practitioners had benefitted from such mobility.
What we found
Our overall conclusion is that Erasmus+ is a well-known, successful EU brand. The Programme generates many forms of EAV which go beyond the legal requirements. Erasmus+ plays a key role in building up learning mobility abroad and has a positive effect on participantsâ€™ attitudes towards the EU. Countries would not be able to achieve such effects acting alone.
In particular, we found that:
Erasmus+ Mobility provides EAV in many ways in addition to those required in the legal basis, such as a strategic approach to mobility, an increase in sense of European identity and multilingualism;
most of the targets for the indicators set in the legal basis are being met. However, these indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation making performance measurement difficult. The qualitative indicators are largely based on perceptions of participants via interviews and surveys;
Erasmus+ introduces many innovations towards administrative simplification for Mobility, although application and reporting processes are still complex;
the innovative Student Loan Guarantee Facility has not produced the expected results leading to the Commission reallocating the relevant funds.
What we recommend
We recommend that the Commission should in particular:
suggest additional EAV elements when designing and implementing the future Erasmus programme. All EAV elements should be prioritised at the project appraisal stage, monitored and reported on;
further develop indicators that help to measure the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achieved, and prioritise performance in the allocation of funds;
further simplify the scheme in order to reduce the administrative burden, make applications and reporting easier for beneficiaries and individual participants and maintain lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, but adjust the grant amounts when necessary. It should also improve IT tools and continue to computerise procedures;
promote the introduction of school student mobility in KA1 and consider applying more flexibility for PhD students;
assess the possibility of reintroducing the funding for traditional classroom language teaching; and
propose appropriate changes to the Student Loan Guarantee Facility to include doctoral and undergraduate mobility.

Introduction
Erasmus+ supports actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, with a total budget of â‚¬16.45 billion for the period 2014-2020. It aims to provide learners and staff with the opportunity to gain skills and undergo personal, socio-educational and professional development through study, training, work experience or volunteering abroad. The Programme also aims to improve quality and foster innovation, excellence and internationalisation of organisations in these three fields. The objective of Erasmus+ is also to help European countries to modernise and improve their education and training systems, reinforcing their role as drivers for growth, employment, competitiveness, innovation and social cohesion.
According to its establishing regulation (henceforth â€œthe Regulationâ€) the Programme shall contribute inter alia to the achievement of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the headline education target. It shall also contribute to the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training, including the corresponding benchmarks (â€œET 2020â€).
Erasmus+ combines the programmes from the period 2007-2013 under one Programme. The activities and projects that it funds are distributed between Key Actions (KA), as shown in Figure 1.

The European Commission (Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture) is ultimately responsible for the implementation of Erasmus+. It manages the budget and sets priorities, targets and criteria. It guides and monitors the implementation, follow-up and evaluation of the Programme at European level. The European Commission also has responsibility for the supervision and coordination of the structures in charge of implementing the Programme at national level.
The implementation of the Erasmus+ Programme is largely (80Â %) based on indirect management (see Figure 2). The European Commission delegates implementation to National Agencies (NA) established in each Programme country. The NA are responsible for managing all stages of the project life-cycle. The NA are designated by national authority(ies), who also appoint an independent audit body in accordance with the Financial Regulation.

The most significant part of the Programme in terms of the EU Budget is KA1. It is made up of mobility projects for learners and staff in higher education, vocational education and training and adult education as well as for staff in school education and for young people. In addition KA1 provides for Erasmus Mundus Joint Masterâ€™s degrees and Erasmus+ Masterâ€™s loans.
Learning mobility provided under KA1 (moving physically to a country other than the country of residence, in order to undertake study, training or informal or non-formal learning, see Annex I for examples) is intended to improve the level of key competences and skills, with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market and their contribution to a cohesive society. Moreover, Mobility is an important means to promote the inclusion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Audit scope and approach
We assessed the performance and European Added Value (EAV) of the Erasmus+ Programme. We focused the audit on KA1 (Mobility) for Education and Training, which makes up more than half of the Programmeâ€™s budget allocation. Projects under KA2 and KA3 have an implementation period of several years and were mostly at the implementing and/or contracting stage in 2017.
In particular, we examined whether:
Erasmus+ Mobility provides the expected EAV;
the results of Erasmus+ Mobility are appropriately measured; and
innovations introduced under Erasmus+ Mobility have improved the Programme.
We selected five Programme countries to visit: Estonia, Norway, Poland, Romania and Spain. Our criteria for the selection of the countries were: (i) the number of participants they receive and send; (ii) a country receiving and sending a relatively low number of participants; (iii) a geographical spread across EU Member States and (iv) one non-EU country.
We obtained evidence from:
interviews with Erasmus+ stakeholders, including:
Commission and European Investment Fund (EIF) staff responsible for the management of Erasmus+;
the National Agencies, national authorities, beneficiaries and participants from the five selected programme countries;
a review of documentation and procedures relating to Erasmus+;
an analysis of data, including the mid-term evaluation (MTE) of Erasmus+ 2014-2016. This was published on 31 January 2018, after the end of our audit period. We reviewed this key document and found that much of it corroborated our findings. We refer to the MTE and its findings where appropriate.
Observations
Erasmus+ mobility creates more forms of European Added Value than that required in the Regulation
Erasmus+ Mobility provides the European Added Value as required by the Regulation
The Programme shall only support actions and activities which present a potential EAV and in particular those which have: transnational character, particularly with regard to mobility and cooperation aimed at achieving a sustainable systemic impact; complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies at national, Union and international level, and a contribution to the effective use of Union transparency and recognition tools.
Transnational character and systemic impact
The transnational character is by definition present. Study, training or work placements abroad are the sine qua non condition of the mobility actions in KA1: a mobility of individuals, either for study, placement, training course, job-shadowing or teaching. By January 2018 more than 2.3 million learners and practitioners had benefitted from Erasmus+ mobility under Education and Training and Youth. Figure 5 shows the number of participants who have undergone Erasmus+ mobility by country during the period 2014-2016.
Figure 5 â€“ Number of Erasmus+ mobilities by country during the period 2014-2016

Source: ECA.
Mobility by design is â€œaimed atâ€ achieving a systemic impact on the education and training systems of the Programme and partner countries. At this stage, the institutions and schools we visited were not yet able to demonstrate a particular systemic effect of their projects either on their institutions or at national level.
The Commission recognises that the systemic effect on education and training systems is â€œless visibleâ€ and that â€œthe evidence of the exploitation of project results by policy makers and the effective engagement of the latter when they are not included in the project itself is not always clearâ€ and â€œthere is only anecdotal evidence that the programme is changing institutionsâ€™ approaches to pedagogy and their target groupsâ€.
Indeed, as stated in the legal basis, individual projects are not required to have a systemic impact. It is the cumulative result of those projects that should contribute to achieving systemic impact and thus such impact may only be visible at the end of the Programme. The Programme Guide states that â€œin the long run the combined effect of the several thousands of projects supported under this Key Action is expected to have an impact on the systems of education, training and youth in the participating countries, thus stimulating policy reformsâ€.
Complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies
The complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies are intended to be primarily ensured by the contribution of Erasmus+ to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the headline education targets. It should also contribute to the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (the mobility benchmarks in â€œETÂ 2020â€).
Whilst Erasmus+ does contribute to the mobility benchmarks, there is no apparent link between KA1 and the headline education target indicator set out in Annex I to the Regulation, as explained in paragraphsÂ 57 and 58 below.
The Commission has set out the link between Erasmus+ and Europe 2020 and ET 2020: â€œThe programme is aimed at boosting skills, employability and the modernisation of education, training and youth systems and supports actions, cooperation projects and tools linked to policy priorities of ET 2020. By doing so, it also contributes to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular the country-specific recommendations in the field of education and training. Investment from Erasmus+ will benefit individuals, institutions and society as a whole, thus contributing to jobs, growth and competitiveness and enhancing prosperity and social inclusionâ€.
In the programme countries we visited we found that the mobility measures do boost skills and employability, notably in the VET sector. At the Programme level, the Mid-term evaluation contains evidence that HE and VET students who have participated in mobility have better employment and salary prospects than their non-mobile equivalents, although much of this evidence so far relates to predecessor programmes.
Feedback from participants reveals very high satisfaction with Erasmus+ mobility and its effect on their employability. For example, 93.8Â % of respondents as at January 2018 declared that they had increased their key competences. 93Â % of staff say they learnt new good practices, 75Â % stating that they had returned with practical skills relevant for their current job. 79.1Â % declared that they had increased their employability. Such feedback, whilst informative and encouraging, may be subjective (see paragraphsÂ 80 to 82).
The 2015 Erasmus+ Annual Report sets out the link between Erasmus+ and other EU policy developments, such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (education and training to restore jobs and growth), and states that â€œthroughout 2015 Erasmus+ implemented the existing EU policy agendas of promoting inclusive learning mobility and cooperation between the various stakeholders involved in the education, training and youth sectorsâ€.
Some Member States use other EU funds to finance mobility via the Erasmus+ mechanisms. For example, Poland tailored its European Social Fund (ESF) Operational Programme in 2016 to finance 2Â 500 School Education participants and 17Â 200 VET participants in Erasmus+. Disadvantaged students also receive additional funds from the ESF.
Contribution to the effective use of EU transparency and recognition tools
Transparency
The Programme Guide states that â€œactivities serving the dissemination and exploitation of results are a way to showcase the work that has been done as part of the Erasmus+ project. Sharing results, lessons learned and outcomes and findings beyond the participating organisations will enable a wider community to benefit from a work that has received EU fundingâ€.
Over 80 success stories have been highlighted in DG EAC's dissemination platforms for Erasmus+. 120 factsheets and 10 videos have been produced on the success stories selected in 2015 and 2016, giving further visibility to these projects. They have been promoted via social media, websites and DG EAC's newsletter, as well as during events. In 2017 the Commission started to publish a monthly Erasmus+ online newsletter, which features a number of success stories. Erasmus+ is the biggest DG-specific Facebook page in the Commission (with nearly 300Â 000 followers).
A new platform (VALOR, or Project Results Dissemination Platform) was established for Erasmus+ to offer a comprehensive overview of projects funded under the Programme and to highlight good practice examples and success stories. The platform makes available products, deliverables and intellectual outputs which are the result of the projects funded. It gives open internet access to descriptions, results and contact information for all projects funded under the Erasmus+ programme, as well as some of the projects funded under its predecessor programmes.
We found evidence that the five countries visited and the Commission are very active in disseminating the results of their projects. 
Recognition
Erasmus+ encourages the recognition of credits earned during mobility. Recognition of credits was not considered to be a problem by the beneficiaries and participants met during our audit. In 2016, a recognition rate of 100Â % was reported for higher education (73Â % in 2013) and 77Â % for VET. The need to earn credits ensures that students have to be assiduous during their mobility.
In the context of VET, the Europass system certifies the international element of the training and gives potential employers more assurance, thereby making the VET students more employable.
Erasmus+ provides European Added Value in additional ways
The EAV of Erasmus+ can be defined as the positive effect brought about by the Programme which would not have occurred without it. Based on this definition we identified additional ways in which Mobility provides EAV, going beyond the EAV sought in the Regulation.
The system of Charters
All participating Programme country HE institutions (both sending and receiving) must obtain the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE). This Charter, developed under the previous Programme, is a guarantee of quality course provision across Europe. No single country would be capable of setting up such a system. We found cases where universities had applied for the Charter just to be able to have it as a mark of quality. The Erasmus+ programme has developed the recognition of credits earned on mobility. The Charter has greatly facilitated this.
Erasmus+ is encouraging VET institutions to apply for the VET Charter. This recently-created Charter is similarly a guarantee of quality and boosts the reputation and attractiveness of a VET institution. We likewise found cases where VET institutions had applied for the VET charter just to be able to have it as a mark of quality.

Network of cooperation and harmonisation of university curricula
Mobility has helped foster cooperation between universities, creating international offices complemented by a system of standard documentation and tools to support student and staff mobility. Changes have been made in university curricula to facilitate student mobility, synchronising the semesters, study periods and the availability of courses across countries. This cooperation also facilitates the transfer of credits and mutual recognition of modules completed and diplomas gained whilst on mobility.
In the HE and VET sectors, Learning Agreements (LA) are drawn up between learners and receiving institutions. These are a form of institutionalised guarantee that credits earned on mobility will be recognised. Signing a LA is a strong predictive indicator for later recognition of the mobility.
In the projects we visited, mobility of HE and Schools staff and VET learners led to subsequent cooperation and exchanges outside Erasmus+.
A strategic approach to mobility
Under Erasmus+ it is HE institutions, VET institutions and schools that apply for Mobility projects to be approved, rather than students/individual teachers. This is a major change from previous programmes which in our view contributes to institutional development. Benefits accrue to the HE institutions who have to propose and implement an internationalisation strategy. VET providers and schools must draw up a European Development Plan, setting out how the proposed mobility project fits with the needs of the institution and its overall development.
This strategic approach helps ensure management buy-in to the objectives of a project as well as longer term retention of links and know-how, creating more sustainable added value.
EAV of mobility of teaching staff
Teaching staff who have been on mobility should put into practice what theyâ€™ve learned upon their return. For example university staff in Estonia and VET staff in Poland stated that they put their mobility experience to use in their home institutions.
Multilingualism
One of the specific objectives of the Programme is to improve the teaching and learning of languages and to promote the EU's linguistic diversity. Language skills contribute to the mobility, employability and personal development of European citizens.
One of the indicators set out in Annex I of the Regulation is the percentage of participants declaring that they have increased their language skills. The score for this indicator is over 96Â % (but see also paragraphÂ 81). Mobility abroad is instrumental in producing such a score.
Lack of language skills can still hold back mobility students, notably outside the HE sector. Our interviews with participants showed that, particularly in the VET sector, lack of language skills can hold back participants and prevent the mobility placement leading directly to employment. The lack of language ability prevented Spanish VET students we met, for example, from obtaining jobs at the end of their mobility in Berlin. Linguistic barriers were cited by respondents to the Open Public Consultation supporting the mid-term evaluation as the most frequent barrier to the achievement of programme objectives.
Cross-border and international mobility
Mobility is an important part of education strategy in most countries. For example Norway has a target of 20Â % of students to participate in cross-border mobility, Estonia has set up a portal -StudyinEstonia- to attract foreign students and Spain would like to co-operate more intensively with South America, by helping to set up international offices and capacity building. Erasmus+ is a very important means and model to achieve this (see FigureÂ 5).
Erasmus+ as part of the EUâ€™s neighbourhood and development policy
Funds are made available from the EU Budget, as provided for in various external instruments, under Erasmus+ in order to promote the international dimension of HE. This funding is allocated to actions in respect of learning mobility between Programme countries and partner countries. Student and staff mobility to or from partner countries funded through the allocation from the DCI must focus on areas that are relevant to the inclusive and sustainable development of developing countries.
In this way Erasmus+ is a form of EU soft power and diplomacy, a political EAV. Development and neighbourhood policies are implemented through the Programme, notably HE mobility with partner countries (see Figure 5).
Under the predecessor programme such projects were assessed at the EU level. Under Erasmus+ projects are assessed in each programme country. This may lead to a reduction in quality as a minimum number of projects are selected in each country.
Increased prominence and prestige of VET
17Â % of the total Erasmus+ budget is dedicated to VET. This compensates for limited national funds available for exchanges of students, teachers and staff in VET. Moreover, VET student exchanges help to make the VET institutions and VET itself more attractive and prestigious. More and more students and staff are participating in VET mobility (see FigureÂ 7).

VET brings Erasmus+ closer to a greater variety of citizens
The inclusion of VET in Erasmus+ brings the Programme closer to a greater variety of citizens, dealing with a wider range of less academic domains (e.g. catering or car-bodywork). Moreover, the inclusion of such disciplines under Erasmus+ provides opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to benefit from mobility. Many of the VET students we met had never left their country, or even their region, before going on their mobility. Annex II shows examples of the types of mobility in the VET sector in the schools/countries visited.
Increase in sense of European identity
The mobility participants we met stated that this participation has increased their sense of European identity. The mid-term evaluation also found that participating in Erasmus+ mobility fostered a sense of feeling European (19Â % more than in non-participants). Moreover, the general public perceives the Programme, and Mobility in particular as it is the most visible part, as one of the pillars of European identity and as a concrete benefit that the EU provides to its citizens. Erasmus+ is one of the most recognisable brands of the EU. 
Thus, Erasmus+ generates many forms of EAV which go beyond the legal requirements. Erasmus+ indeed plays a key role in building up learning mobility abroad and has a very positive effect on participantsâ€™ attitudes towards the EU. Countries would not be able to achieve such effects acting alone.
The performance measurement of Erasmus+ Mobility has weaknesses in certain key areas
Effective performance management, including evaluation and monitoring, requires the development of specific, measurable and realistic performance indicators which can be measured over time and which reflect the logic of the intervention. This intervention logic is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8 - Erasmus+ KA1 Mobility Intervention Logic Model

The general objectives of Erasmus+, as far as Education and Training is concerned, are to contribute to the achievement of: the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the headline education target; the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) as well as the corresponding benchmarks; the sustainable development of partner countries in the field of higher education; and the promotion of European values in accordance with article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union. Specific objectives for Education and Training relevant for KA1 mobility are set out in Article 5.
The specified targets are being met, but some indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation
Some of the indicators set out in the Regulation need to be improved to better serve the performance assessment framework
The Programme has a set of indicators for its evaluation. These indicators are described as â€œmeasureable and relevantâ€ and â€œintended to measure the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achievedâ€. Those indicators set for KA1 Mobility are shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9 - Indicators for the evaluation of the Programme

Source: Annex I of the Regulation.
We examined whether these indicators are appropriate. The Commission claims that â€œthe programme is on track to achieve or exceed the vast majority of the targetsâ€.
It is not clear how the Mobility projects financed help meet the Europe 2020 headline education target
The Europe 2020 indicators were set by the Council. The Commission reported â€œThe indicators linked to Europe 2020 education headline target, namely tertiary educational attainment and early school leaving showed continuous progress (â€¦) In 2016, the early school leaving rate in the EU was 10.8Â % that is 2Â decimal points lower than in 2015 (...) At the same time, the EU average percentage of people aged 30-34 with a tertiary education degree rose by 3Â decimal points to 39.0Â % in 2016â€.
However, it is not clear how the projects financed under Mobility, help meet these headline education targets. Moreover, even if they did contribute, that contribution cannot be distinguished from that of other national and EU actions and separately measured.
Thus, there is no apparent link between Mobility, or even Erasmus+ as a whole and the headline education target indicators. These Europe 2020 indicators are not aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation as required by article 5(2).
As the mobility benchmark only contains partial results, it is not being properly measured
In 2011, Member States agreed on the EU benchmark for higher education mobility, whereby in 2020 at least 20Â % of higher education graduates should have had a period of higher education-related study or training (including work placements) abroad.
They also set a benchmark for learning mobility in VET: by 2020 at least 6Â % of VET graduates should have had VET-related study or a training period abroad (including work placements).
Higher education mobility in Erasmus+ is a key driver to meet the benchmark for mobility in that sector. The mobility benchmark is clearly linked to KA1. However, Erasmus+ is not the only programme contributing to mobility and thus the contribution from Erasmus+ cannot be fully identified.
Moreover, the data underpinning this benchmark is only available on a very partial basis according to analysis undertaken by the Centre for Research on Lifelong Learning (CRELL), and it is not available on a comparable basis across Europe. Thus the results for this indicator are not accurate.
A comprehensive assessment of the level of mobility in VET is not possible because of limited data availability. Eurostat undertook a pilot survey to assess VET learning mobility which it completed at the end of 2015. The results showed that in the 17 Programme countries participating in the survey, around 3.1Â % of VET students had taken part in learning mobility.
As this indicator only contains partial results, it is not being properly measured.
The quantitative (general) indicators provide useful information, although some definitions need to be harmonised and refined
These indicators relate specifically to Mobility and are reported and monitored by the Commission. Progress (as at the end of 2016) towards the targets for these indicators, which are set in the DG EAC Annual Work Programme, is summarised in Figure 10.
Figure 10 - Quantitative (general) Indicators

Erasmus+ Mobility promotes the inclusion of learners with fewer opportunities. It is not clear why the indicator in the legal basis groups such participants with those with special needs. Moreover, according to the 2016 Erasmus+ Annual Report â€œthe Programme continues to fight barriers to mobility by becoming more inclusive for those from a disadvantaged background and those with special needsâ€. Thus, this terminology is not being used consistently.
Nearly 205Â 000 participants from disadvantaged backgrounds and with fewer opportunities benefitted from Erasmus+ by taking part in transnational mobility activities over the period 2014-2017. Erasmus+ Mobility has offered new experiences abroad to many people who would otherwise have not been able to afford it.
The definition of â€œdisadvantaged/fewer opportunitiesâ€ differs in each Programme country. For example in Spain, all beneficiaries receiving a government grant for studies are included in this category. Indeed, according to the Commissionâ€™s data, over 35Â % of mobility participants from disadvantaged backgrounds are from Spain.
Consequently, the results for this indicator do not provide an accurate comparison of such mobility across EU countries. The Commission recognises that one of the main issues that affected the analysis of participation patterns is â€œthe absence of a harmonised definition, across sectors, of people with fewer opportunities and from disadvantaged backgroundsâ€ and that â€œthe quality of the data on participation of disadvantaged groups is unclear due to various definitions and practicesâ€.
These three indicators measure outputs of the Programme and help to demonstrate progress in implementation. Thus, they provide little information about the outcomes and impact of the Programme (see Figure 8).
Education and Training indicators are being met, but they do not address the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achieved
The Education and Training indicators in Annex I to the Regulation are specific to the Programme. Progress under these indicators for 2016 are shown in FigureÂ 11 and FigureÂ 12 below, which indicate that most targets are being met.
Education and Training indicators (a) to (d) in Figure 11 are output indicators. Even though these quantitative indicators are useful they do not fully measure â€œthe extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achievedâ€, notably the specific objectives, as required in Annex I of the Regulation.
Figure 11 - Output indicators

Source: Annual Activity Report, DG EAC, 2016.
Indicators (e) to (g) are outcome indicators that provide information about the benefits of participating in the Programme. Indicator (f) is a subjective measure, based on the perception of the individual, as reported at the end of the mobility.
Figure 12 - Outcome indicators

Source: Annual Activity Report, DG EAC, 2016.
The Commission recognises the limitations of these indicators in that â€œthey are mostly based on the self-perceived contribution of KA1 reported by beneficiariesâ€. It states that the National Reports, underlying the MTE, report improvements in the level of key competences and skills in learners, but it recognises that this is â€œmostly based on the self-reported perceptions of participantsâ€.
The Dashboard provides real-time information about outputs and outcomes
In 2016 the Commission launched its Erasmus+ Dashboard, which is a single data warehouse collecting all the information that is recorded by the NA and the beneficiaries. The data is updated on a daily basis and provides real-time, qualitative and quantitative data relating to the implementation of the Programme in terms of projects, grants, participants and organisations involved in the Programme. It records the survey and post-mobility declarations of participants and beneficiaries.
According to the Dashboard, participant satisfaction is high: 95.8Â % were satisfied with their learning mobility experience (as at January 2018) and 80Â % felt better prepared for finding a job. Indeed Erasmus+ is a success, based on the survey and post-mobility declarations.
The sources used to measure performance in the mid-term evaluation are to a large extent surveys and participant feedback
The MTE report on the Erasmus+ Programme was submitted on 31 January 2018. It builds on: National Reports of the Programme countries, an evaluation report by an external contractor, other reviewed studies, experience in managing the programme, and over a million responses from interested parties. In respect of Erasmus+ it covers the period 2014-2016.
The sources for the MTE are to a large extent surveys and participant feedback: â€œThe evaluation combined a number of techniques for data collection and analysis. Most results are reached by a mix of evidence... based on beneficiariesâ€™ surveys, self-reported feedback of beneficiaries, as well as qualitative interviews and case studiesâ€. In addition an Open Public Consultation gathered the opinions of the general public and interested groups.
Our meetings with the compilers of the National Reports in the five countries visited indicated difficulties arising from the lack of robust data to help in assessing the impacts of the Programme.
Post-mobility questionnaire for participants is subjective and complex
After completion of the mobility, each participant has to fill in a questionnaire to evaluate overall satisfaction and specific aspects of participation in the Programme, such as home institution recognition of the mobility, increase in sense of European identity and improvement in language skills.
This participant feedback is useful but, as it is subjective, should not be used as the main measure for assessing the quality and results of a mobility. It is all the more subjective as the final payment to the student is conditional on the questionnaire being completed, although such payment is not conditional on a positive self-assessment.
The students we met said that the questionnaires were too complex (in particular for VET) and use too much EU jargon. Some students reported difficulties in filling in the questionnaires. For example the Norwegian NA stated that the questions are not appropriate for VET students.
Little continuity from year to year in the priorities in the Erasmus+ Annual Work Programmes
The Commission established policy priorities for Erasmus+ in 2014. Some of these have been maintained in subsequent AWP, while others have been discontinued and new policy priorities introduced.
The priority â€œSystemic changes of education and training systems with a view to increasing their labour market relevance, through enhanced work-based learning opportunitiesâ€, introduced in 2014, is not included in subsequent AWP.
None of the 2014 priorities for VET remain in the 2017 AWP. However, each subsequent year saw additional priorities. In HE, the priority â€œto increase attainment levelsâ€ was withdrawn from the 2017 AWP and new priorities were introduced.
These priorities are relevant, however no quantitative targets or indicators have been set. It is not clear to what extent the objectives of these priorities have been met, nor why many were discontinued. There has been little continuity from year to year in the priorities established by DG EAC in the Erasmus+ AWP.
The allocation of funds is not based on performance
The allocation of funds should be based on performance to promote an efficient and effective use of resources. The Regulation requires that the criteria used to measure performance focus on â€œthe level of annual realised outputs and the level of annual payments realisedâ€.
We do not consider these criteria sufficient to measure the performance of the Programme. They merely measure how much can be spent (inputs and outputs). Performance also covers outcomes and impact as recognised in the Regulation.
To conclude, the performance measurement of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas. Targets are being met but the indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation, making performance measurement difficult.
Erasmus+ has introduced many innovations but some of them have not yet reached maturity
Consolidation under Erasmus+ is a success
Erasmus+ combines the programmes from the period 2007-2013 under one Programme (see Figure 1). In respect of mobility, it includes the former ErasmusÂ (HE), LeonardoÂ (VET) and ComeniusÂ (SE) Programmes. The NA we met -and in a paper by all NA Directors- consider this to be positive. Having a single brand name brings better visibility at the political level and for the public and contributes to increasing the sense of European identity (see paragraphÂ 50).
The indirect management approach is positive
The indirect management approach increases the effectiveness of projects. Being close to the beneficiaries, NA can better contribute to improving the quality of project proposals and their implementation, adapting them to the diversity of national education and training systems. The beneficiaries we interviewed confirmed that the NA provide good assistance and feedback during the application and implementation phases and organised events and training courses to facilitate access to the Programme.
Erasmus+ introduces many innovations towards administrative simplification, although application and reporting processes are still complex
The implementation of the Programme should be simplified by reducing formal and bureaucratic requirements for beneficiaries and Member States. Streamlining and simplifying the organisation and management, and a sustained focus on reducing administrative expenditure, are vital to the success of the Programme.
Only a minority of NA (36Â %) find Erasmus+ to be a lesser burden than predecessor programmes. Beneficiaries and participants still find the programme complex (applications, implementation, reporting). Participants interviewed found project application and reporting for VET to be repetitive, with the same information to be provided in several instances. Smaller organisations considered the need to describe the â€œEuropean impactâ€ of their individual mobility projects to be excessive.
Participants in nearly every country complained about complex administrative procedures related to applications and reporting. We found that some students consider the LA to be complicated to fill in and students can find that the content of a course has been changed upon their arrival. Course catalogues are sometimes not updated. This can cause disappointment on arrival as some students find that their intended course no longer exists.
Some of the participants we met found application forms to be too complex for schools. One particular difficulty is in setting out how the projects will meet the objectives in the European Development Plan. Application forms have been simplified for the 2018 call.
The Commission has produced a comprehensive Programme Guide intended to help the beneficiary organisations and individual participants. It is updated every year. However, it is difficult to identify the changes made from year to year in the Programme Guides, as these are not indicated. The NA we visited stated that they would appreciate an online handbook (currently in pdf format) with all the source documents -and marked updates- in one single document. The 2017 Programme Guide has since been made available online.
Some of the institutions we met felt the rules for HE mobility with partner countries to be too complex. The implementation of such mobility was very difficult during the first year, with 10 amendments to the financial agreement between the university and theÂ NA. In this area simplification has not yet been achieved.
Lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are a good simplification, but the Commission should ensure that undesired effects are avoided
The implementation of Erasmus+ was simplified by the use of lump sum, flat rate and unit cost funding. The mid-term review on simplification of grants found that the use of such funding has led to many financial and non-financial benefits in the implementation of the Programme. It simplified budget planning, reporting to the NA and accounting. Moreover, the review found that, because of the reduced administrative burden, programme beneficiaries are able to focus on project content during the planning stage and on achievement of their projectâ€™s aims during the implementation stage.
We found that stakeholders appreciate the introduction of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs which have brought about simplification in the financial management of the programme.
However, in order to enhance access to Erasmus+, the grants to support the mobility of individuals should be adjusted to the living and subsistence costs of the host country.
The lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are set out in the Programme Guide and are divided into three groups: countries with similar, higher and lower living costs. Some students and institutions we met reported that Erasmus+ grants are insufficient to cover costs and that additional funding is needed from a studentâ€™s own savings or parental support. This can discourage disadvantaged students from taking part.
We found that no adjustments to grant amounts are made to reflect the real costs for participants in the case where the receiving country provides specific subsidies, e.g. a studentâ€™s rent is often paid by the State in France, which means that such participants are in an advantageous situation.
Unit costs based on distance bands do not take into account the existence or frequency of connections or differences in prices between tourist destinations and geographically remote places. Using the distance calculator benefits those located in major cities with airports.
Following comments from NA the Commission has made adjustments to certain elements for the 2017 call, for example top-ups for expensive domestic travel costs. Moreover, based on evidence provided by the mid-term review on the simplification of grants, adjusted funding rules will apply as of 2018.
The introduction of IT systems was problematic, but most issues have now been resolved
The introduction of a large number of IT tools at the beginning of the Programme caused confusion for NA and applicants. The IT tools provided by the Commission were initially of variable quality and were introduced late. The Mobility Tool was considered unreliable and not user-friendly and many issues were only gradually taken into account (e.g. eForms, EPlusLink and OEET). All of the countries we visited reported problems in integrating the new tools, which had not been piloted before their introduction.
The Commission resolved most of the problems with the introduction of its 2016 IT Action Plan. The improvements were confirmed by the NA during our visits.
We found that NA, beneficiaries and participants would welcome more electronic documentation, leading to a paperless Erasmus+. Many Erasmus+ documents were still in paper format.
The Online Linguistic Support is a useful tool. However, the non-online courses funded under the previous programme are considered essential
One of the specific objectives of Erasmus+ is to improve the teaching and learning of languages.
The Commission has created the Online Linguistic Support (OLS), giving learners the opportunity to assess their skills in the foreign language they will use to study or work in the host country, as well as to follow an online language course to improve their level.
All mobility participants have to complete an online linguistic assessment to evaluate their language skills before and after the completion of their mobility. Such results would provide quantifiable data on improvement in such skills. The OLS test is compulsory in order to obtain the final grant payment.
We found that in a number of instances the scores achieved in the questionnaire upon completion indicate that the language skills have remained the same or even decreased. The Commission believes that apparent decreases in language levels between the first and final assessment reflect a lack of motivation on part of the participants due to the lack of incentives at this stage of their mobility. Thus these final tests, although essential, should be treated with care when measuring improvements in linguistic ability.
According to some HE institutions the OLS tests do not generate language competence certificates which meet the recognition criteria imposed by many European universities. Indeed the Coimbra group of universities believes that there is an over-emphasis on online language tests and weak support for effective on-site language courses.
Some VET participants also regret the absence of non-online language courses under Erasmus+, for which funding was available under the previous programme. In Estonia for example the absence of language courses in an auditorium is regretted as these were better at encouraging learners.

The Student Loan Guarantee Facility has not met expectations
The Student Loan Guarantee Facility provides partial guarantees to financial intermediaries in respect of loans granted â€œon the most favourable terms possibleâ€ to students undertaking a second-cycle degree, such as a Masterâ€™s degree, in another Programme country.
The Facility is managed and implemented by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the Commission. Up to 3.5Â % of the total Erasmus+ budget was originally assigned to this Facility.
The objective was to provide â‚¬3 billion of loans to 200Â 000 Master students by 2020, thereby boosting student mobility in Europe in line with the EU's 20Â % Mobility benchmark target.
The EIFâ€™s Delegation Agreement with the Commission provides targeted incentives for it to select a financial intermediary from each Programme country, in order to ensure that students from all such countries have access to the Facility. Despite EIF conducting a market survey which revealed significant interest from such intermediaries, and the EIF actively promoting the Facility to over 120 financial institutions, the subsequent calls for expression of interest did not attract many of them. At the end of 2017 the scheme was only operating via one such intermediary in each of France and Turkey (outgoing students only), and Spain (outgoing and incoming students).
By then only 358Â Master students had received such a loan. Although feedback from participating students was positive, 77Â % confirming that they would not have been able to study for their Masterâ€™s degree abroad without the loan guaranteed through the scheme, the target of up to 200Â 000 students is unlikely to be met. At the end of 2017 the Commission reallocated the relevant funds.
One of the reasons for the lack of interest from financial intermediaries may be that the Regulation makes the protection for borrowers too inflexible, not taking sufficient account of standard market practices. This protection is specifically set out in paragraphÂ 2 of AnnexÂ II of the Regulation.
Moreover, the Facility covers a narrow target population (Master students), excluding sizeable segments of students, which further reduced the interest of financial intermediaries.
In 2017 EIF concluded agreements with the Universities of Luxembourg and Cyprus, whereby the latter will allow incoming Master students to defer payment of their tuition and accommodation costs for two years, covered by guarantees agreed under the Facility. This innovative approach is positive, as universities are increasingly playing a role in financing higher education.
Other features new to Erasmus+ need attention
It is no longer possible for school students to participate in mobility under KA1
Participation in mobility under KA1 is no longer possible for school students. National Agencies and schools in the countries visited regretted the absence of such mobility. Moreover, it is anomalous that students of the same age can participate in VET mobility, but not as school students under KA1.
Many VET institutions have difficulties in finding partners and often have to resort to intermediaries
The VET institutions we visited reported difficulties in finding partners for high quality mobility. Examples of such difficulties are in Figure 14. Some resort to using intermediaries, which can be expensive and reduce the funding available for mobility. The VET institutions visited would appreciate more support from the Commission and NA in finding partners.
Moreover, whereas Leonardo covered expenses such as preparatory visits for teachers to inspect new host partners, this is no longer the case under Erasmus+. VET institutions expressed the wish for more support to enable the administrative staff and teachers to accompany students at the beginning and end of mobility, as well as preparatory visits. Accompanying visits are very important as the students are often teenagers and for many it is their first time abroad.
The Commission has recently created an online map of VET Charter holders where colleges can seek partnerships with colleges abroad which are deemed to be reliable.

Flexibility for PhD students is needed
Under previous schemes it was possible to organise short, intensive programmes that were highly appreciated especially by PhD students. Currently the minimum period allowed is three months. The Higher Education institutions we visited argued that such students need more flexibility and that a period of one month better reflects their availability.
Conclusions and Recommendations
We found that Erasmus+ is a well-known, successful EU brand. The Programme generates many forms of EAV, many of which go beyond the legal requirements. Targets are being met but the performance assessment framework of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas so as to measure the extent to which general and specific objectives are being met. Innovative features and simplification measures have been introduced, but some stakeholders still find key aspects cumbersome.
The Erasmus+ Mobility actions satisfy the EAV criteria set out in the legal basis (see paragraphsÂ 14 to 31). We have identified additional ways in which these actions generate EAV (see paragraphsÂ 32 to 51).
Although most targets specified for the programme are being met, we found that the indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation, making performance measurement difficult. Therefore, the performance assessment framework of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas (see paragraphsÂ 52 to 88). The systemic impact of Mobility has not yet been demonstrated (see paragraphsÂ 16 to 18).
Most indicators are quantitative and output-based. The qualitative ones are largely based on perceptions of stakeholders and participants via interviews and surveys. Participant feedback is useful but, as it can be subjective, should not be used as the main measure to assess the quality and results of the mobility actions (see paragraphsÂ 54 to 82).
The performance criteria for the allocation of funds set by the Regulation are merely measures of inputs and outputs, and not outcomes and impacts. In our view performance has to be assessed in terms of progress towards achieving objectives in order to comply with the Regulation. Moreover, there is little continuity of policy priorities for Erasmus+ from year to year (see paragraphsÂ 83 to 88).
Erasmus+ introduced many positive innovations, notably to simplify and reduce the administrative burden for participants, beneficiary institutions and NA. However, improvements are still needed to make participation less burdensome and more attractive for beneficiaries, notably in the application and reporting processes. Only a minority of NA (36Â %) find Erasmus+ to involve a lesser burden than predecessor programmes (see paragraphsÂ 90 to 97).
Lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are a good simplification, but the Commission should ensure that unwarranted effects are avoided (see paragraphsÂ 98 to 104).
The introduction of IT systems was very problematic at first, but most issues had been resolved by 2017. Nevertheless the MTE found that â€œprocedures and IT management tools should be made easier to use to reduce the administrative burden on implementing bodies and beneficiariesâ€. E-applications need to be encouraged (see paragraphsÂ 105 to 107).
The Online Linguistic Support is a useful complementary tool for self-learning and testing the language level. However, it could in future be supplemented by non-online courses funded under the previous programme (see paragraphsÂ 108 to 113).
In respect of the Student Loan Guarantee Facility, the participation of financial intermediaries is limited, and the intended impact is not being achieved. The EIF has sought innovative and flexible solutions. Expanding the potential loan portfolio to other cycles in the successor programme might increase the attractiveness of the scheme for financial intermediaries (see paragraphsÂ 114 to 121).
Recommendation 5
The Commission should:
propose appropriate regulatory and legislative changes to widen the Student Loan Guarantee Facility to include doctoral and undergraduate mobility;
take appropriate action to encourage Programme countries to ensure that their National Promotional Institutions participate in the existing Facility.
Target implementation date: (a) first semester 2021, (b) 2018.
We found significant demand for the reintroduction of school student mobility in Erasmus+ Key ActionÂ 1 (see paragraphÂ 122).
The minimum mobility period of three months for PhD students is not always appropriate. Such students need more flexibility (see paragraphÂ 126).
