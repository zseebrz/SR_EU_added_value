EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 
2006 to show EU solidarity towards workers affected by mass redundancies. 
The EGF should facilitate the re-integration into employment of those workers 
by providing financial contributions for time-limited and coordinated packages 
of personalised services. Such packages include active labour market 
measures such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and 
outplacement. They also often include income support and other allowances 
paid to workers.
II.	The European Social Fund (ESF) also supports redundant workers, mainly 
through lifelong learning programmes. However, whereas the purpose of the 
ESF is to address long-term structural imbalances, the EGF was designed to 
address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
III.	Until 31 December 2012, EGF aid packages represented 627 million euro 
for 89 approved member states applications. The EGF co-finances measures 
at a rate of 50 % or 65 %, with the balance being provided by the Member 
State concerned.
IV.	The Court concluded that:
(a)	Nearly all EGF eligible workers were offered personalised and well-
coordinated measures.
(b)	Each EGF measure may also be eligible for the ESF and some Member 
States preferred to use the ESF rather than EGF.
(c)	 No quantitative re-integration objectives were set. Moreover, existing data 
are not adequate to assess the effectiveness of the measures in re-
integrating workers into employment.
(d)	The EGF delivered EU added value when used to co-finance services for 
redundant workers or allowances not ordinarily existing under Member 
States’ unemployment benefit systems.
(e)	However, in all the audited cases, the Court identified measures to provide 
workers with income support, which would have been paid by the Member 
States anyway. Sixteen of the 19 Member States that benefited from the 
EGF included income support measures in their packages. Globally, 
income support measures represented 33 % of the costs refunded for all 
EGF cases.
(f)	The EGF approval procedure, requiring the need for an ad hoc budgetary 
procedure, is very long. This hampers EU solidarity with the redundant 
workers targeted. 
V.	The Court recommends that:
(a)	The Member States and the Commission take the necessary steps to 
ensure the availability of up-to-date and reliable data in order to monitor the 
achievement of objectives, as well as to compare the outcome of the 
various measures.
(b)	The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission consider 
limiting EU funding to measures likely to provide EU added value, rather 
than funding already existing national workers’ income support schemes.
(c)	The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission consider, as 
an alternative to the current EGF scheme, the possibility of adapting the 
ESF framework and its funding allocations in order to support more rapidly 
workers affected by mass redundancies.
INTRODUCTION
1.	The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 
2006 to show EU solidarity towards workers affected by mass redundancies. 
The EGF should facilitate the re-integration into employment of those workers 
by providing financial contributions for time-limited and coordinated packages 
of personalised services . Such packages include active labour market 
measures such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and 
outplacement. They also often include income support and other allowances 
paid to workers. 
2.	The EGF is outside the Multi-annual Financial Framework. As a result each 
application for EGF support submitted by a Member State has to pass a 
thorough assessment by the Commission and obtain approval from the EU 
budgetary authority (Council and European Parliament). The Commission 
shares the management of the EGF with the Member States.
3.	Redundant workers can also benefit from the European Social Fund, mainly 
through lifelong learning programmes. However, whereas the purpose of the 
ESF is to address long-term structural imbalances, the EGF was designed to 
address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
4.	The EGF supports workers made redundant as a result of major structural 
changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation (500 dismissals or more  in 
one or more enterprises in the EU) where those redundancies have a 
significant adverse impact on the regional or local economy (the “trade 
criterion”). In this respect, applicant Member States must demonstrate that the 
redundancies are linked to a substantial increase of imports into the EU, the 
rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to 
third countries.
5.	By way of derogation, from 1 May 2009 to 31 December 2011, the EGF was 
also applicable to workers made redundant as a direct result of the global 
financial and economic crisis (the “crisis criterion”) . 
6.	For instance, when the effects of the crisis devastated the Danish 
shipbuilding industry, there were redundancies as a consequence. In that 
Member State, the EGF supported redundant workers of the last Danish 
shipyard (see Picture 1). Another example is the German automotive supply 
industry, which was particularly hit in the regions of Lower Saxony and North 
Rhine-Westphalia (see Picture 2).

7.	From 9 March 2007 (date of the first application) to 31 December 2012, total 
EGF aid approved amounted to 627 million euro (379 million euro from the EU 
budget and 247 million euro from the Member States) for 89 approved 
applications  from a maximum yearly budgetary ceiling of 500 million euro 
during the 2007-2013 period. The EGF co-finances measures at a rate of 50 % 
or 65 % , with the difference coming from the Member State concerned. 
8.	The EGF is currently scheduled to run until 31 December 2013. The 
Commission has however proposed to continue with a new EGF Regulation 
until 31 December 2020 .
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
9.	The overall objective of the audit was to assess the contribution made by 
the EGF, in the form of EU added value, to enabling redundant workers to 
return to the labour market as soon as possible. The Court examined in 
particular the following questions:
(a)	Did all affected workers benefit from personalised EGF measures, and 
were EGF co-financed active labour market measures coordinated with 
other similar measures (i.e. ESF and Member State measures)?
(b)	Was the EGF effective in terms of labour market re-integration? 
(c)	Is the nature of the EGF measures likely to deliver EU added value?
(d)	Was the EGF approval procedure implemented in a timely manner?
10.	Eight cases in four Member States (two each in Denmark, Germany, Ireland 
and Lithuania) in which the EGF was deployed, were audited on the spot. 
They amounted to 67 million euro out of 627 million euro (10,7 %) of EGF aid 
committed until 31 December 2012. The sample of eight cases only comprised 
implemented cases and reflected the different sizes of EU economies, the 
diversity of the economic sectors affected and important differences between 
the EGF intervention criteria (see Table 1).

11.	The audit covered the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012. 
The audit was carried out through interviews, the examination of documents 
held by the Commission and the four audited Member States authorities, and 
an analysis of the data on re-integration rates.The audit in the Member States 
also included the organisation of eight focus group meetings at which the 
various local EGF stakeholders (academics, administrations and social 
partners) could share their views (see Picture 3).

12.	In addition to the above, the results of the Commission’s mid-term 
evaluation of the EGF were analysed . The mid-term evaluation report of 
December 2011 covered the first 15 cases  co-financed by the EGF in eight 
Member States. One of these (Nokia, Germany) was included in the sample 
audited on-the-spot by the Court.
13.	Finally, the Court carried out a survey by addressing questionnaires to 
Member States (Bulgaria, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, 
Slovakia and the United Kingdom) in order to identify the reasons why they did 
not use the EGF.
OBSERVATIONS
Nearly all workers were offered personalised and well-coordinated 
measures 
14.	In order to demonstrate solidarity to all affected workers personalised 
measures should be offered not only to the workers made redundant in the 
main enterprise affected, but also to those employed by suppliers of that 
enterprise. 
15.	In the audited cases nearly all affected workers could benefit from EGF 
measures. No instances of the intentional exclusion of potential beneficiaries 
were identified.
16.	However in the cases of Karmann and Dell, the Court found that an 
unknown number of redundant workers formerly employed by the affected 
enterprises’ suppliers were not included in any EGF support measure .The 
main reasons for non-inclusion lay in the difficulties faced by Member States in 
assessing which suppliers were affected. 
Services were personalised
17.	Services offered to the potential beneficiaries were generally tailored to their 
needs and therefore most likely to get results. This positive aspect already 
reported by the mid-term evaluation was confirmed by the Court’s assessment 
of the eight EGF cases audited. Concrete examples of personalised services 
are provided in Box 1.
?
Box 1 - Three cases of packages of personalised services in Ireland and 
Denmark
In the case of Dell, the Irish authorities provided child care support and distance 
learning services. County and City Enterprise Boards delivered special courses for 
redundant Dell workers (“Start Your Own Business”), as well as mentoring to cope with 
administrative procedures. 
In the case of SR Technics, some courses, such as aeronautics courses with the Irish 
Aviation Authority, had been specifically designed. Where relevant courses could not 
be provided specifically for redundant workers, grants were released to allow them to 
take part in appropriate courses delivered to a larger population (80 % were technical 
courses or aviation industry-related). For the first time ever in Ireland, the Training and 
Employment Authority worked together with the Department of Defence and the 
Department of Education and Skills to set up apprenticeships for civilians.
In Denmark (Odense Steel Shipyard (I)), the EGF facilitated the implementation of 
high quality training measures. These measures were of a more long-term and 
personalised nature and leading to qualifications superior to those which were 
normally offered to unemployed persons, and the possibility of sectoral reconversion. 
According to several participants in the focus group organised by the auditors, the 
personalised services went well beyond the scope of national personalised measures 
and were perceived as a unique opportunity, as they gave redundant workers 
ownership of their personal re-integration project.
18.	In Ireland, the applications did not always establish the link between 
personalised services and actual labour market needs. As a result, at this 
stage, it was not identified whether the measures put forward were best suited 
to support the re-integration of the redundant workers.
EGF measures were generally well-coordinated with national measures 
and the ESF
19.	In order to maximise theeffects of EGF measures, the EGF Regulation 
states that they should always take the form of a coordinated package of 
personalised services. What is meant is coordination with measures preceding 
or concomitant to the personalised services co-financed by the EGF . Member 
States should also coordinate their interventions with the Structural Funds , in 
particular the ESF.
20.	The Court observed that, generally, the Member States effectively 
coordinated the EGF with ESF and national labour market measures. Existing 
ESF measures were usually complemented by additional EGF measures 
specifically designed to address workers’ needs. 
21.	Moreover, for the eight audited cases, the Court did not detect instances of 
overlap between the different measures, or double-funding of individuals. 
Some Member States preferred the ESF over the EGF
22.	Although the ESF is not expected to address unforeseeable events, all 
measures under the EGF Regulation may equally be applied under the ESF . 
Whether or not the ESF may co-finance support for workers subject to a mass 
redundancy caused by an unforeseeable event, essentially depends on the 
national eligibility rules and the content of operational programmes. 
23.	The Court’s survey of Member States having never used the EGF 
intervention concluded on the following reasons for preferring the ESF over the 
EGF:
(a)	The higher co-financing rate for the ESF (up to 85 %) than for the EGF (up 
to 65 %) is a disincentive to apply for the latter. This was stated by six 
Member States  and had already been recognised by the Commission in 
2010 .
(b)	The ESF can be implemented more swiftly than the EGF, or national 
administrations are more familiar with the ESF .
(c)	The lack of EGF pre-financing . 
(d)	The length of the procedure for approving EGF applications .
24.	The more restrictive EGF conditions, in particular the trade criterion, are 
another reason why the ESF is preferred over the EGF. After a mass 
redundancy, some Member States may find it easier to redirect ESF funding 
towards support for redundant workers rather than apply for EGF funding. For 
instance, the British authorities never requested EGF assistance in spite of 
having identified 18 cases that might have qualified for such support .
Re-integration into employment of EGF supported workers cannot be 
reliably assessed
25.	In order to assess the performance of a fund it is necessary to monitor and 
evaluate its results and impacts and to compare them to other schemes having 
similar objectives. Taking into account its objective the EGF’s most relevant 
performance indicator is its capacity to reintegrate  redundant workers. 
26.	The Court verified that the re-integration rates calculated as a percentage of 
the re-integrated workers out of the affected workers were available for all eight 
audited cases. Table 2 shows these percentages for different standard cut-off 
periods.

27.	Whilst re-integration data at the end of the EGF measures was available for 
all employers except the case of SR Technics, data were often not available 
(“NA”) for the other cut-off periods shown in Table 2. In the case of Odense 
Steel Shipyard (I), due to the timing of the EGF measures , there were no data 
available about the situation of affected workers after one year. A complete 
overview was possible only for Lithuania. The table shows that the EGF made 
a certain contribution to the re-integration of redundant workers. 
28.	In the most successful example (“Construction” case, Lithuania), 59 % of all 
the redundant workers were re-integrated at the end of the EGF measures. The 
lowest rate of re-integration at that stage was 21 % of workers immediately re-
integrated after the end of the EGF assistance (Dell case, Ireland). Taking the 
situation 12 months after the end of the EGF measures, the highest re-
integration rate reported was 68 % (Karmann case, Germany); however, in only 
four of the eight cases were any data available at that stage. 
Lack of re-integration objectives and specific EGF performance data 
29.	A multiplicity of factors adversely affected the quality and availability of re-
integration data. Firstly, the Member States generally did not set quantitative 
re-integration objectives. Out of the eight cases audited only one   included 
such an element. As a result, it is not possible to assess the measures’ 
effectiveness in terms of achieving their objectives.
30.	Secondly, in Germany, Denmark and Ireland, the public or private 
employment services, when collecting re-integration data, did not 
systematically differentiate between the EGF, the ESF and other national 
measures specifically designed for workers affected by mass redundancies. 
31.	For instance, in Germany, the combination of several ESF and EGF-funded 
training modules made it difficult to isolate the impact of individual measures, or 
groups of measures, on re-integration . External factors (overall economic 
situation, involvement of Volkswagen in the case of Karmann, employment 
subsidies) also had an important impact on re-integration.
32.	Thirdly, Member State authorities audited generally did not distinguish 
between the two main kinds of EGF measures: 
(a)	active labour market measures such as training, aid for self-employment, 
coaching and outplacement;
(b)	income support paid to workers.
33.	Whilst this significant distinction was absent in Germany, Denmark and 
Ireland, the Lithuanian managing authority went so far as to provide re-
integration data that distinguished between the workers participating in each of 
the various measures.
34.	In addition, there is no specific information, allowing the identification of the 
ESF co-financed projects that could actually have met the EGF intervention 
criteria. This identification would have been useful in order to make 
comparisons between the re-integration rates achieved by funds with different 
budgetary, legal and operational arrangements. In turn, this would have 
contributed towards measuring the impact of EGF. The insufficient quality 
(inaccuracy, incompleteness and inconsistency) of ESF monitoring information 
available has already been highlighted in previous performance audits by the 
Court. In particular, the Commission does not have consistent and reliable 
performance data on EU supported targets, and its assessment and 
supervision are currently not oriented towards performance .
Re-integration data were difficult to compare
35.	Comparing re-integration data is a difficult exercice under any 
circumstances. As stated in the EGF mid-term evaluation both supply-side (the 
qualifications of redundant workers) and demand-side factors (local economic 
and labour market conditions) influenced the re-integration results . 
36.	However, in the context of the EGF an additional element hampered this 
comparison. This refers to the differences between the timing of the EGF and 
that of other labour market actions, as those workers in greater need of help 
were left to the EGF, which is relatively slower to implement (see Box 2 and 
paragraph 42). 
37.	In particular, given that the ESF and EGF both support the training and re-
integration of the unemployed, such a comparison is necessary with respect to 
sound financial management as it could highlight potential structural problems. 
The example below (Box 2) illustrates this.
Box 2 - Nokia’s transfer companies – unequal performance owing to differences 
in timing
The mobile phone company Nokia closed its Bochum (North-Rhine-Westphalia) site 
on 30 June 2008. Three transfer companies (as they are called under German law) 
were successively set up to accommodate temporarily redundant workers.
The first transfer company (exclusively supported by ESF funding), was set up in June 
2008, seven months before Germany even applied for the EGF. That company yielded 
a re-integration rate of 66 %. The third and last transfer company was only set up 
when EGF funding was applied for, in February 2009; it achieved a re-integration rate 
of 4,35 %.
The Nokia case speaks volumes – not because ESF funding performed so much 
better than the EGF, but because the ESF proved quicker to mobilise than the EGF 
and thus delivered better re-integration results. Indeed, the EGF alone had to cater for 
persons with more difficult cases and who could not be successfully re-integrated by 
the previous transfer companies.
38.	The above example shows that timeliness is one of the most important 
criteria when a fund including re-integration objectives aims at some degree of 
success. The Nokia case also shows that the EGF and ESF both supported the 
same target group, but for reasons diametrically opposed to the purpose for 
which each fund was designed. The ESF, a structural fund, alleviated an 
emergency; the EGF, an emergency fund, supported those whom it was more 
difficult to reintegrate. 
39.	In fact the EGF and ESF intervene as complementary funds which provide 
either long-term strategic help, or act as a one-off time-limited and specific 
response to a single restructuring emergency.
Germany
40.	The managing authority did not consider a comparison between different 
sets of re-integration data to be feasible. As a result, it neither identified a 
comparable statistical population group for the group of EGF beneficiaries, nor 
made a comparison with overall re-integration rates at Federal level.
Denmark
41.	Due to missing data, no comparison was possible between the re-
integration results of EGF project participants and general re-integration rates 
outside the audited cases. 
Ireland
42.	Surveys conducted by the managing authority concluded that, within the 
same time frame, the employment rate for redundant workers who did not 
benefit from the EGF was higher than the employment rate for EGF 
beneficiaries. The difference in employment rates can be partially explained by 
the fact that some persons did not finalise training or education pathways.
43.	Nonetheless, according to the managing authority, a probable cause of the 
EGF’s lower re-integration rate in Ireland would be differences between the 
profiles of redundant workers, the most skilled workers finding a job without 
EGF help.
Lithuania
44.	EGF re-integration results varied significantly from one EGF project to 
another, depending on the measures implemented and the target group 
addressed, which made a straightforward comparison impossible.
The Commission
45.	Monitoring information was only available to the Commission in the form of 
the EGF final reports, six months after the end of the implementation period. 
However, as a result of the inconsistency and unreliability of the re-integration 
data (see paragraphs 25 to 44), these reports prevent any reasonable 
comparison between different EGF cases, or between the measures applied in 
each case.
46.	In particular, the final reports do not provide an in-depth analysis of the 
nature and the percentage of allowances paid or committed for all the  EGF 
cases approved so far. Furthermore, the Commission’s database did not allow 
the identification and fund allocation of the individual EGF measures nor 
performance indicators like participation figures or re-integration rates. Also, no 
information is provided on the individual ESF or national measures having 
preceded or complemented the EGF ones.
One third of EGF funding compensates national workers’ income support 
schemes, with no EU added value
47.	The EU added value goes beyond the concept of simple added value. It can 
be defined as the value that an EU action adds to the value that would 
otherwise have been created by Member States acting alone. In particular, 
expenditure from the EU budget must offer clear and visible benefits for the EU 
and its citizens which, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, 
are better achieved at Union level . 
48.	The Court refers in particular to the OECD definition of active labour market 
programmes.  Accordingly, measures aiming at the improvement of the 
beneficiaries’ prospect of finding gainful employment or otherwise increasing 
their earnings’ capacity are qualified as active and therefore are considered to 
meet the conditions for an EU added value. These measures  include not only 
services such as training, aid for self-employment, coaching and outplacement, 
but also mobility allowances and educational grants, as well as allowances 
granted in the context of the EGF and not ordinarily existing under the Member 
State’s unemployment benefit system. 
49.	By contrast, workers’ income support measures, consisting of 
unemployment benefits and programmes for early retirement, cannot be 
considered as delivering EU added value. Indeed, workers’ income support 
does not represent an ‘active’ labour market measure  and moreover this 
reduces the share of these measures in the EGF package. In the mid-term 
evaluation, the Commission had already reported that on average only 26 % of 
EGF spending consisted of training measures .
50.	As can be seen in Table 3 below, a common pattern among the eight 
audited cases is that they included EGF measures to provide income support, 
which would have been paid by the Member States anyway, irrespective of 
EGF intervention. The impact of this type of EGF intervention is to compensate 
part of the cost of the Member States’ unemployment benefit system, and there 
is no added value in such an intervention other than EU additional funding for 
the Member States.
Workers’ income support measures represent the majority of the co-
funded expenditure for half of the cases audited
51.	For each of the cases of the audited sample the Court calculated the 
amounts of EGF funding committed to the different types of measures and in 
particular to workers’ income support (see Table 3). 
Table 3 - Breakdown of EGF funding by type of personalised measures in 
the eight EGF cases audited

 

Source: ECA, based on available data from DG Employment, Social Affairs and 
Inclusion and Member State authorities.
52.	In six of the eight cases shown in Table 3, the EGF packages included a 
relatively high proportion of income support. Indeed, in Germany and Denmark, 
one case in Ireland and one in Lithuania, more than a third of the total value of 
the respective packages of personalised measures was composed of income 
support. 
53.	In the particular cases audited in Germany and Denmark, training measures 
meant to re-skill or up-skill redundant workers represented only a third or less 
of the respective EGF packages. On the other side, income support measures 
in the form of unemployment benefits or the equivalent represented 50 % to 
73 %. In those cases, moreover, the link between a redundant worker’s income 
support and his/her effective participation in an EGF funded labour market 
measure such as training could not systematically be established.
Globally, workers’ income support measures account for one third of re-
funded costs
54.	In the absence of a satisfactory EGF database of cases, the Court 
examined the Member State application data collected by the Commission for 
each of the 89 EGF cases for which information was available and relevant. It 
was found (see Table 4) that 33 % of EGF support for workers (thus excluding 
technical assistance to Member States) was composed of income support 
measures such as unemployment benefits.

55.	Six Member States have been allocated 29 % of the total EGF co-financing 
and 89 % of all the income support measures approved to date. As well as 
Germany and Denmark, the six included Austria, Italy, France and Malta . 
56.	The Court also notes that the Commission’s proposal for the next 
Multiannual Financial Framework seeks to limit EGF support in the form of 
allowances, which include workers’ income support, to a maximum of 50 % of 
any EGF package . 
Different EGF co-funding in similar economic circumstances
57.	The Court notes inconsistent outcomes in similar economic circumstances 
with respect to workers’ income support measures in the case of Germany as 
compared to Austria , which are the two most intensive users of this kind of 
EGF support.
58.	O Germany considered for EGF funding purposes that the duration of the 
training or qualification measures  represent slightly less than half of workers’ 
normal working time . By contrast, Austria considered that similar measures 
represented 100 % of the normal working time. This is due to the fact that the 
Austrian short-term allowance scheme provides for a definition of full-time 
occupation to be as low as 50 % of the normal working time.
59.	 As a consequence of these different national decisions, EGF co-funding of 
short-term allowance represented proportionally the double in Austrian cases 
when compared to German cases. The Court notes however that this 
difference in the EGF funding decision did not affect ultimately the individuals 
as they received in full the allowances foreseen in the national schemes.
The EGF approval procedure is too long for an emergency fund
60.	In order to maximise its impact the EGF should be able to provide its 
financial contribution rapidly in order to allow the affected workers to benefit of 
the funded measures as soon as possible after having been made redundant.
61.	After having established the average length of the approval procedure, the 
Court assessed to what extent it can be made shorter taking into account the 
different legal provisions and rules to be respected.
62.	The EGF approval procedure is the process from the moment a Member 
State officially applies until the Commission and the Budgetary Authority 
commit the financial contribution to an EGF case. It can be divided into 
consecutive stages (called later assessment procedure, budgetary procedure 
and empowerment procedure), which last together on average 41 weeks.
Graph - Schematised view of the EGF approval procedure
 
The assessment procedure could be shortened
63.	The assessment procedure is composed of the appraisal procedure and the 
Commission’s internal consultation procedures leading to the adoption of the 
proposal for a decision by the budgetary authority. It takes on average 
30 weeks. 
64.	The appraisal procedure takes on average 15 weeks when taking as a 
starting point the date of the official application of the Member State, but it is 
much longer when taking into account informal exchange of information 
between the responsible Member State authority and the Commission.
65.	One of the factors contributing to the length of the appraisal procedure is 
the possibility foreseen in the EGF Regulation to supplement Member State 
applications any time after they officially applied. Introducing a time limit to this 
possibility as well as taking stock of learning curve benefits may reduce the 
length of 15 weeks necessary to appraise applications of Member States who 
are in emergency situations. The subsequent internal consultations within the 
Commission also take 15 weeks on average.
The budgetary and empowerment procedures have a further impact on 
timeliness
66.	As the EGF operates outside of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, 
each EGF case is subject to a specific budgetary procedure in order to make 
available the related appropriations. In practice, this means that once the 
Commission has identified sufficient margins and/or cancelled commitments, 
the decision to deploy them has to be taken by the budgetary authority . This 
budgetary procedure requires an additional and incompressible period of 
approximately seven weeks. 
67.	Then the empowerment procedure completes the approval procedure, 
leading to the adoption of the formal decision to pay a financial contribution. Its 
length, an average of 4 weeks, is closely linked to the provisions of the 
Commission’s rules of procedure . Finally, once agreed, the financial 
contribution is paid to the Member State concerned.
The EGF approval procedure is not timely
68.	To conclude, the approval procedure is very long, especially considering 
that the EGF is supposed to be an emergency fund. In the mid-term evaluation 
report, evaluators already pointed out to the Commission in 2011 that the long 
EGF approval procedure could be considered too slow to offer a genuinely 
‘rapid response’ mechanism in times of crisis.
69.	The length of the entire approval procedure is of an average of 11 weeks 
longer than for an ordinary financing decision of the Commission.
In the end, the budgetary authority approved all the projects submitted by 
the Commission 
70.	The budgetary authority has approved all proposals submitted by the 
Commission. Only one out of 114 applications has ever been rejected. This is 
likely due to the Commission’s very effective support for Member States during 
the application stage. Indeed, in all of the eight audited cases the Court found 
sufficient evidence of effective support for the Member States. 
71.	Furthermore, not one audited or surveyed Member State authority 
expressed dissatisfaction with respect to the Commission service responsible 
for the EGF, but pointed instead to issues concerning the EGF procedure as a 
whole rather than the quality of support.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
72.	The Court is aware of the need for showing EU solidarity towards workers 
affected by redundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns. 
However, the Court is not convinced that all the features of the current EGF 
mechanism are the most appropriate to deliver specific support with EU added 
value to redundant workers.
Nearly all eligible workers were offered personalised and well-
coordinated measures
73.	Nearly all eligible workers could benefit from personalised EGF measures. 
However, in some cases redundant workers formerly employed by the 
suppliers of an affected enterprise were not included in EGF support 
(paragraphs 14 to 18).
74.	In general, EGF support was well coordinated with ESF and national labour 
market measures, in that existing measures were complemented by additional 
EGF measures specifically designed to address workers’ needs (paragraphs 19 
to 21).
75.	Whereas the ESF is intended to address long-term structural imbalances, 
the EGF was designed to address short-term and ad-hoc emergency situations. 
Although the ESF is not expected to address unforeseeable events, all 
measures under the EGF Regulation may equally be applied under the ESF. 
Some Member States have preferred to deploy the ESF rather than the EGF 
owing to the higher co-financing rate, quicker implementation and the 
availability of pre-financing, as well as the lengthy approval procedure and 
more restrictive conditions under EGF (paragraphs 22 to 24).
Re-integration into employment of EGF supported workers cannot be 
reliably assessed
76.	Re-integration data exist but are not sufficiently accurate, consistent or 
detailed for any conclusions to be drawn. As a result, no useful comparisons or 
benchmarking could be made between EGF measures within an EGF case, 
EGF cases between one another or EGF cases against other active labour 
market programmes. No quantitative re-integration objectives were set 
(paragraphs 25 to 46).
Recommendation 1
In order to improve the quality of the information on the achievements of the different 
cases and on the effectiveness of measures supporting redundant workers, the 
Member States and the Commission should take the necessary steps to ensure the 
availability of up-to-date and reliable data in order to monitor the achievement of 
objectives, as well as to compare the outcome of the various measures.
One third of EGF funding compensates national workers’ income support 
schemes, with no EU added value
77.	When used to co-finance services for redundant workers or allowances not 
ordinarily existing under Member State unemployment benefit systems, the 
EGF delivered EU added value. This refers in particular to active measures 
aiming at the improvement of the beneficiaries’ prospect of finding gainful 
employment or otherwise increasing their earnings’ capacity such as training, 
aid for self-employment, coaching and outplacement, mobility allowances and 
educational grants (paragraphs 47 to 49).
78.	However, in all the audited cases the Court identified measures to provide 
workers with income support, which would have been paid by the Member 
States anyway. Consequently, the Court considers that only training and direct 
active support measures for redundant workers have an EU added value other 
than additional funding for the Member States. Sixteen of the 19 Member 
States which benefited from the EGF included income support measures in 
their packages. Income support measures represented 33 % of the costs 
refunded for all EGF cases (paragraphs 50 to 56).
79.	The Commission did not sufficiently monitor the weight of workers’ support 
measures (paragraphs 45 to 46). In addition, different Member State decisions 
may result in different EGF co-funding for similar  income support measures 
(paragraphs 57 to 59).
Recommendation 2
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should consider limiting 
EU funding to measures likely to provide EU added value, rather than funding already 
existing national workers’ income support schemes.
The EGF approval procedure is too long for an emergency fund
80.	The EGF approval procedure is very long. This has a deterrent effect as 
regards the use of the EGF and consequently hampers EU solidarity with the 
redundant workers targeted. 
81.	In addition, the need for a budgetary procedure  adds to the overall length of 
approval (paragraphs 60 to 69).
Recommendation 3
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should consider, as an 
alternative to the EGF scheme, the possibility of adapting the ESF framework in order 
to support more rapidly workers affected by mass redundancies.

GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONS
Catalyst: An agent that stimulates or precipitates a reaction, development or 
change.
Centralised Management by the European Commission:
-	Direct: The budget implementation tasks are performed directly by 
Commission departments.
-	Indirect: The Commission entrusts tasks of public authority, and in 
particular budget implementation, to agencies created by the Commission 
(executive agencies), traditional agencies or joint undertakings, other bodies 
such as the European Investment Bank or the European Investment Fund, 
national public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public 
service mission (so-called "national agencies").
DG Environment: Directorate-General for the Environment of the European 
Commission
EC: European Council
Effectiveness: Achieving the objectives set.
Environment Action Programmes (EAPs): These are adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council and set out the EU’s key environmental 
objectives and priorities. They are multi-annual and aim to identify the EU’s 
major environmental challenges, to set objectives and to provide guidelines. 
The EU’s first environment action programme dates back to 1973. The 6th EAP 
expired in mid-2012. The European Commission has proposed a new 
Environment Action Programme (the 7th) entitled “Living well, within the limits of 
our planet”, which will be considered through the ordinary legislative procedure 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
EU: European Union
EU Interest: In the context of LIFE Environment projects, a synonym for 
European Added Value. EU interest means contributing to the achievement of 
the general objectives of EU environmental policy, by targeting a problem with 
significant importance at European level or expecting to generate results that 
would be widely applicable. 
Impact: The positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effect 
produced by an intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.
Impact assessment: The assessment of the economic, social and 
environmental consequences of policy and legislative proposals. It is a tool to 
ensure that Commission initiatives and EU legislation are prepared on the basis 
of transparent, comprehensive and balanced evidence. 
Indicator: Quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that provides simple and 
reliable means to measure achievement, to reflect the changes connected to 
an intervention or to help assess the performance. Indicators should be 
relevant, accepted, credible, easy and robust (“RACER” criteria). 
(a)	Input indicators: These measure the quantity, quality, and timeliness of 
resources provided for an intervention.
(b)	Output indicators: These measure deliverables created or provided by the 
intervention. They provide information to assess the efficient use of inputs.
(c)	Outcomes indicators: Result and Impact Indicators
-	Result indicators: These measure the immediate or short-term results 
of the implementation of the intervention. They provide key information 
on the extent to which an intervention achieves its objectives. 
-	Impact indicators: These measure positive and negative, primary and 
secondary longer-term effects produced by an intervention, directly or 
indirectly, intended or unintended. 
Integrated Projects: projects implementing on a large territorial scale, in 
particular on a regional, multi-regional or national scale; environmental or 
climate strategies or action plans required by specific EU environmental or 
climate legislation, pursuant to other EU acts or developed by Member States’ 
authorities.
Intervention: Any action or operation carried out by public authorities or other 
organisations, regardless of its nature (policy, programme, measure or project).
LIFE: L’Instrument Financier pour l’Environnement (The Financial Instrument 
for the Environment).
Monitoring: Regular examination of the resources, outputs and results of 
interventions.
Output: Something that is produced with the resources allocated to an 
intervention.
Project replication: The reproduction of the whole project or parts of it.
Project results dissemination: The process of making the results and 
deliverables of a project available to the stakeholders and to the wider 
audience. 
Project sustainability: The continued existence of the project.
Results: The direct effects or changes that arise due to the intervention.
Thematic strategies: The 6th EAP introduced the Thematic Strategies as an 
instrument for its implementation and covered seven thematic areas: soil 
protection; protection and conservation of the marine environment; sustainable 
use of pesticides; air pollution; improving the quality of the urban environment; 
the sustainable use and management of natural resources and waste 
prevention and recycling.
These strategies are based on a global approach, by theme, rather than on 
certain pollutants or types of economic activity, as had been the case in the 
past. They set long-term objectives and provide an opportunity to simplify and 
clarify existing legislation.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I. The EU’s environmental policy is integrated across the EU’s main policy 
areas. The vast majority of EU funding for the environment is therefore 
delivered as part of the EU’s main spending policies, such as the structural 
funds and the common agricultural policy. LIFE (L’Instrument Financier pour 
l’Environnement) is directly managed by the Commission. It is now in its fourth 
programming period and the current LIFE programme has an average annual 
budget of 239 million euro for financing projects – which represents less than 
1,5 % of estimated overall environmental related expenditure by the EU. This is 
a modest budget for an ambitious objective: to contribute to the development, 
updating and implementation of EU environmental policy and legislation. 
Almost 50 % of this budget, or 120 million euro, is devoted to the LIFE 
Environment component.
II. The Commission has proposed to increase the available budget for the LIFE 
Environment component in the next programming period. The Court therefore 
carried out an audit to assess the effectiveness of the LIFE Environment 
component of the LIFE programme. This involved an examination of whether 
the design and implementation of the LIFE Environment component contributed 
to programme effectiveness.
III. The Court found that overall, the LIFE Environment component was not 
operating effectively because it was not sufficiently well designed and 
implemented. The main design problems were:
(a)	The lack of a mechanism to target scarce resources on pre-selected 
objectives dissipated the impact of the invested funds. 
(b)	The indicative national allocations hampered the selection of best projects 
because projects were not only selected based on their merit but also on 
their Member State of origin. 
(c)	The quality of the project selection was adversely influenced by the 
insufficient justification of evaluation results.
(d)	The monitoring framework of the programme lacked appropriate common 
output and result indicators. This prevented the Commission from getting a 
comprehensive and updated overview of the performance of projects, and 
therefore from estimating the operational effectiveness of the programme.  
IV. The main implementation problems that hampered effectiveness were:
(a)	Key aspects of LIFE projects, concerning their innovative and demonstrative 
character, their sustainability prospects and EU interest, were not always 
appropriately assessed during project selection.
(b)	The monitoring  of the reasonableness of project costs, their sustainability 
and replication was insufficient.
(c)	The expected role of the component as a catalyst for environmental policy 
was greatly reduced due to insufficiently effective dissemination and low 
sustainability and replication of projects. 
V. The Court recommends that the Commission implements the following 
recommendations: 
1.	In the establishment of the multi-annual work programmes foreseen 
in the new LIFE programme, the legislative authorities should enable 
the Commission and the Member States to restrict eligible 
applications to limited strategic priorities, and to set clear, specific, 
measurable and achievable objectives for projects to be funded. A 
limited number of priorities fixed for a number of years would 
streamline the selection process, concentrate the efforts on specific 
issues and facilitate the evaluation of the programme impact.
2.	The Commission’s proposal for the new LIFE programme ends the 
national allocation for traditional projects but keeps a geographical 
balance for Integrated projects. In its application, the Commission 
should ensure that Integrated projects are selected based on their 
merit, and that geographical balance should not breach the principle 
of equal opportunities for applicants.
3.	The Commission should improve the project selection evaluation 
forms and require the evaluators to provide separate assessments 
and scores for major project aspects (such as innovative or 
demonstrative character of the proposal, the quality of the 
dissemination actions planned, or the potential for the replication of 
results), in order to improve the quality and transparency of the 
selection process and to ensure that selected projects have the 
potential to contribute most towards the achievement of the 
programme objectives.
4.	The Commission should improve its programme management tools 
and consider introducing adequate common output and result 
indicators as well as follow-up information at project level, in order to 
facilitate an appropriate monitoring of the programme. To the extent 
possible, such indicators should be relevant, accepted, credible, easy 
and robust (“RACER” criteria).
5.	The Commission should improve its assessment of the 
reasonableness of claimed personnel costs, particularly for 
comparable projects, by making better use of information collected 
during the monitoring phase. This could then be better used to 
facilitate the identification of excessive costs. 
6.	The Commission should require the monitoring team to include in its 
assessments a critical analysis of the dissemination, sustainability 
and replication measures proposed by the beneficiary and of the 
potential barriers that might hinder them, both in its evaluation 
reports during the project implementation as well as in its ex-post 
visit reports.
7.	The Commission should consider how to better encourage the 
dissemination and replication of project results by private 
beneficiaries who wish to protect their commercial interests.
8.	The Commission should consider how to require the beneficiaries to 
electronically submit simple and updated information after the project 
completion (i.e. whether the project remains operational, whether the 
project is replicated, and if yes, how many times, ...). This would 
enable the Commission to efficiently improve its ex-post information 
on programme effectiveness.


INTRODUCTION
Funding the environment in the EU 
1.	The environment is an increasingly important policy area for the European 
Union. With the Treaty of Amsterdam (1999), the Union recognised that the 
environment needed to be integrated, in terms of both definition and 
implementation, into all its other policies (e.g. Transport, Enterprise, Research 
and Enlargement). Due to the cross-cutting nature of environmental issues, the 
main Community expenditure programmes (in particular the Structural Funds, 
the Cohesion Fund and Agricultural expenditure, and other assistance 
programmes implemented outside the EU) include aspects related to 
environmental policy. 
2.	Figure 1 shows the estimated environment related expenditure for the 
period 2007 to 2013 by expenditure programme. The LIFE programme, with a 
budget of 2,1 billion euro, represents less than 1,5 % of total environmental 
related expenditure.

LIFE+ Regulation: Options Development. 

The LIFE Programme
3.	The current LIFE programme  covers the period from 2007 to 2013 and has 
three components: 
(a)	LIFE Nature and Biodiversity, which co-finances best practice or 
demonstration projects that contribute to the implementation of the Birds 
and Habitats Directives, the Natura 2000 network. In addition it co-finances 
innovative or demonstration projects that contribute to the implementation 
of the objectives of the Commission's Communication on “Halting the loss 
of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond”. 
(b)	LIFE Environmental Policy and Governance (hereafter LIFE Environment), 
which co-finances innovative or demonstrative projects related to climate 
change, water, air, soil, urban environment, noise, chemicals, environment 
and health, natural resources and waste, forests and innovation.
(c)	LIFE Information and Communication, which supports projects that 
disseminate environmental information, such as information about climate 
change or nature conservation, networking or best-practice platforms.
4.	LIFE is directly managed by the Commission . Given that most of the EU 
environmental expenditure is integrated into other expenditure programmes, 
LIFE stands as the environmental backbone of the EU. Its overall objective is to 
contribute to the development, updating and implementation of EU 
environmental policy and legislation, including the integration of the 
environment into other policies. It should therefore serve as a platform for 
developing and exchanging best practices and for sharing knowledge, to 
catalyse and accelerate change on environmental and climate issues. In 
practice, LIFE supports the general (political) environmental priorities set by the 
Council and the European Parliament in the Environment Action Programmes 
(EAP). LIFE Environment projects cover a very wide range of sectors, including 
climate change, chemicals, water and natural resources, as outlined in Box 1. 
5.	The current LIFE Environment component has an average annual budget of 
some 119,5 million euro. From 1996 until 2012 this component provided 
1,3 billion euro to 1 730 projects (see Table 1). The LIFE Environment 
component is presented in Figure 2. It shows the intervention logic underlying 
the component and the interplay between its main elements: “policy setting and 
evaluation”, “project implementation” and “results and impact”.
6.	As a result of the relatively limited budget of the LIFE Environment 
component, both compared with its extensive objectives and overall EU 
environmental spending, its effectiveness is strongly determined by whether 
funded projects serve as catalysts for environmental change. This means that 
the successful completion of a project is not by itself enough to ensure the 
overall effectiveness of the programme. Indeed, if the projects do not address 
problems with significant importance at European level and their results are not 
adequately monitored, disseminated, sustained and replicated, the overall 
objective of contributing to environmental policy is unlikely to be achieved.

AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
7.	The Court identified a number of risks to the effectiveness of the LIFE 
Environment component of the programme in achieving its objectives. In 
particular, the risks that the combination of a high number of priority actions 
and the relatively low budget could lead to a lack of focus and inconclusive 
results, the weaknesses in the project monitoring and evaluation systems for 
drawing conclusions about the programme and the lack of a multiplier effect 
due to the insufficient dissemination of project results. Given the Commission’s 
intention to significantly increase the programme’s budget for the next 
programming period 2014-2020, the Court decided to carry out an audit in 
order to assess these risks in more detail. 
8.	The objective of the audit was to answer the question “Does the LIFE 
Environment component of the LIFE programme  operate effectively?”. This 
was done by addressing the following audit sub-questions: 
-	Was the LIFE Environment programme well designed in order to facilitate 
effective results? In order to answer this question, the Court examined the 
consistency of objectives with the available budget, how the budget was 
allocated and the design of the project selection and monitoring processes.
-	Was the LIFE Environment programme well implemented in order to obtain 
effective results? In order to answer this question, the Court examined the 
application of the selection criteria, and the monitoring, dissemination, 
sustainability and replication of projects.  
9.	The above questions consider the criteria necessary to achieve the catalytic 
effect and thus the overall effectiveness of the Environment component of the 
programme.
10.	The audit focused on the projects funded between 2005 and 2010. The 
Court visited the Commission’s relevant services and five Member States from 
among the largest beneficiaries of LIFE (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the 
United Kingdom), representing 55 % of the LIFE budget and 15 % of its 
projects. 
11.	In total 25 projects were visited on-the-spot in the five Member States . 
Relevant documents were examined to check the purpose, eligibility, existence, 
sustainability and potential replication of the projects, and to verify whether best 
practices and lessons learned were appropriately disseminated by the 
Commission. In addition, relevant information related to project selection and 
monitoring, as well as information on the project websites was analysed for a 
sample of 70 projects.
12.	Interviews were carried out with representatives of the Commission, the 
evaluation team, the monitoring team  and representatives of the national or 
regional authorities acting as national or regional contact points (NCP). 
OBSERVATIONS
Part I – Design 
The large number of objectives of the programme was not consistent with 
the limited available budget
13.	In order to be effective, programmes should not only define clear and 
specific objectives, but these should be realistic and consistent with the 
allocated budget. More concretely, programmes should include a limited 
number of defined specific priorities in order to target available resources on 
attaining the objectives set. This is particularly important for LIFE, given its 
expected catalytic role to promote developments in the EU environmental 
policy and its relatively limited budget.
14.	The LIFE Regulation set many eligible objectives for LIFE Environment 
component projects (see Box 1). From 2008, the Commission narrowed down 
these objectives in its annual call for proposals into “indicative priority areas”. 
However, in practice this did not result in much greater targeting of specific 
priorities because proposals outside these priorities are eligible for funding, as 
long as they relate to any of the many objectives under the Regulation. 
Therefore despite its modest budget, LIFE Environment funds projects across 
twelve different policy areas and involving very different issues and interests. 
Even if good projects are being financed, this inevitably translates into a lack of 
critical mass of projects to promote meaningful developments in EU 
environmental policy and prevents any real impact on policy areas.
Box 1 – LIFE Environment: A small budget …
The LIFE Environment component represents around 0,5 % of the estimated EU 
environmental expenditure for the period 2007-2013. 
But with many ambitious objectives (listed in Annex II of LIFE+ Regulation)
(a) Climate change: to stabilise greenhouse gas concentration at a level that prevents 
global warming above 2°C.
(b) Water: to contribute to enhanced water quality by developing cost-effective 
measures to achieve a good ecological status in view of developing the first river basin 
management plan under Directive 2000/60/EC  by 2009.
(c) Air: to achieve levels of air quality that do not give rise to significant negative 
impacts on and risks to human health and the environment.
(d) Soil: to protect and to ensure the sustainable use of soil by preserving soil 
functions, preventing threats to soil, mitigating their effects and restoring degraded 
soils.
(e) Urban environment: to contribute to improving the environmental performance of 
Europe’s urban areas.
(f) Noise: to contribute to policy development and implementation on environmental 
noise.
(g) Chemicals: to improve the protection of the environment and health from risks 
posed by chemicals by 2020 by implementing chemicals legislation.
(h) Environment and health: to develop the information base for policy on the 
environment and health (the Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010).
(i) Natural resources and waste: (a) to develop and implement policies designed to 
ensure sustainable management and use of natural resources and waste, and to 
improve the environmental performance of products, sustainable production and 
consumption patterns, waste prevention, recovery and recycling; (b) to contribute to 
the effective implementation of the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling 
of waste.
(j) Forests: to provide, especially through an EU coordination network, a concise and 
comprehensive basis for policy relevant information on forests in relation to climate 
change (impact on forest ecosystems, mitigation, substitution effects), biodiversity 
(baseline information and protected forest areas), forest fires, forest conditions and the 
protective functions of forests (water, soil and infrastructure) as well as contributing to 
the protection of forests against fires.
(k) Innovation: to contribute to developing and demonstrating innovative policy 
approaches technologies, methods and instruments to assist in the implementation of 
the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP).
15.	Table 1 shows the amounts that LIFE Environment spent by priority area in 
the years 1996 to 2012. Even within the priority areas, the projects cover a 
wide range of sectors and the total amount involved represents around 0,5 % of 
total EU environmental related expenditure (see paragraph 5).
Table 1 – LIFE Environment (1996-2012): number of projects and amount 
funded by priority area 
 
Source: Mid-Term Evaluation of the Implementation of the LIFE+ Regulation. GHK 
April 2010 and Commission services.
16.	Consequently, the fact that the LIFE programme does not have a 
mechanism to allocate its limited resources to the indicative favoured actions, 
prevents the Commission from focusing project applications on a limited 
number of specific priorities, which means that LIFE does not necessarily focus 
on pre-selected policy areas but funds the policy areas of the selected projects. 
In the Court’s view, this is not consistent with the catalytic role expected from 
the programme.
The national allocations hampered competition among project proposals
17.	LIFE funds cover a wide range of areas in the whole territory of the EU. In 
order to fund the best possible projects, applications should go through a 
competitive selection process whereby the best projects are selected for 
funding. 
18.	Since 2007 the LIFE programme has been designed to provide a 
proportionate distribution of projects among the Member States. Article 6(2) of 
the LIFE+ Regulation establishes indicative national allocations , based on 
population and on the percentage of the national territory designated as a 
Natura 2000 area. 
19.	The indicative national allocations intend to secure funding for smaller 
Member States by “blocking” a part of the budget for them. But as highlighted in 
the impact assessment supporting the Commission’s proposal for the new LIFE 
Regulation, their allocations are by definition small and this reduces their 
interest and commitment to the programme. As a result, the system did not 
stimulate more applications from these Member States. 
20.	Furthermore, the Court found that the national allocations distort the results 
of the evaluation criteria used for the selection process and can result in 
projects, depending on their Member State of origin, being selected with lower 
evaluation scores than rejected projects from other Member States. For 
example, in 2009 three projects from Italy, Poland and Finland, with a final 
score of 55 points were refused for co-financing while one French project with 
only 46 points and two British projects with 50 points were retained.
21.	The system magnifies competition between projects in the same country, 
rather than ensuring the best projects are selected at European level. The 
European added value of the programme is therefore reduced.
The templates used to evaluate project proposals did not require enough 
justification of the evaluation results, which undermined transparency in 
the selection process
22.	The project selection process is a cornerstone for the quality of spending 
programmes and a necessary condition for their effectiveness. This process 
should ensure transparency and equal opportunities for all applicants, be based 
on objective criteria and target projects that contribute most towards the 
achievement of the programme objectives. A transparent and effective 
selection process requires evaluation forms that reveal the score given to each 
of the criteria and their justification.
23.	LIFE projects are selected on the basis of a call for proposals launched 
every year by the Commission. While the Commission receives assistance 
from a consortium of external evaluators to evaluate project proposals, it 
remains responsible for the selection process. 
24.	The overall selection process of LIFE Environment proposals takes place in 
four phases: Eligibility, Selection, Award and Revision. The process is outlined 
in Annex I. For the two first phases of the evaluation process – eligibility and 
selection – each proposal is examined by one evaluator. In the award phase, 
the proposals have to be assessed independently by two expert evaluators. In 
case of significant divergence, a third assessment of the proposal is required. 
The final decision on the score to be given to each proposal is taken during a 
meeting chaired by the Commission’s services and attended by the evaluators. 
25.	The evaluators use standard templates, prepared by the Commission, to 
appraise project proposals on the basis of pre-defined selection criteria. Each 
of these criteria is further developed into a series of more specific aspects to be 
considered . While for the award phase the templates require the evaluators to 
score and give opinions in favour and against each major criterion, there is no 
requirement to justify the assessment or to score the different aspects included 
in each major criterion. 
26.	The audit found that key aspects for the effectiveness of the programme, 
such as the innovative or demonstrative character of the proposal, the quality of 
the dissemination actions planned, or the potential for the replication of results 
were not considered as standalone evaluation criteria, but as one among the 
several aspects inside the evaluation criteria. In practice this meant that the 
evaluators were not required to score and justify their assessment of these key 
aspects of LIFE Environment projects. In the Court’s view, this represents a 
weakness in the design of the project selection system .
27.	In fact, the Court found that the aggregation of different key aspects under 
the same evaluation criterion, without requiring the evaluator to give an 
individual score led to situations where the scores given were not sufficiently 
justified in the evaluation templates (see Box 2) or where important aspects 
were not appropriately assessed (see Box 3 and paragraph 41)
Box 2 – Evaluation score not sufficiently justified
A German proposal received predominantly negative comments concerning the 
evaluation criterion 1. Under this criterion the evaluators should assess the innovative 
nature of the proposal, the significance of the expected environmental progress and its 
technical feasibility.
The evaluator noted in the evaluation form that the only innovative character resided in 
the process not in the methods and concepts.
The evaluator scored this criterion with 6 points out of a maximum of 10. In the Court’s 
view, the negative narrative assessment provided in the evaluation form does not 
justify this score. 

28.	Furthermore, providing an overall score to an evaluation criterion without 
scoring the underlying aspects prevents an objective and thorough re-
performance of the evaluation work carried out. This undermines transparency 
of the programme’s selection system. 
The monitoring framework was not appropriate and this hampered 
efficient programme management
29.	Appropriate management of any kind of programme requires a regular 
examination of inputs, outputs and results, in order to obtain up to date 
information on whether the programme is progressing as intended, in other 
words, a monitoring framework. Monitoring informs managers during 
programme implementation about the achievement of operational objectives, 
so that problems can be identified and corrected in a timely manner.  A sound 
monitoring framework should contain, for example, a set of common input, 
output and result indicators. These should allow data at project level to be 
aggregated at programme level and to be compared against pre-defined 
objectives and targets. 
30.	Monitoring should not stop when projects are completed. In the LIFE 
programme, ex-post monitoring would be useful to determine whether or not 
the outputs and expected results continue to be generated, to check that there 
are no sustainability-related problems, or the extent to which project results 
have been transferred or replicated elsewhere.
31.	The Commission monitors project implementation, assisted by a consortium 
of experts acting as an external monitoring team. The team makes annual site 
visits to inspect the project progress, either alone or with a desk officer from the 
Commission. The monitoring team assesses the regular reports of project 
implementation, which the beneficiary submits to the Commission.
32.	During their project visits the monitoring team assesses the delivery of 
outputs and the achievement of results as stated in the project proposals, and 
assesses the technical and financial eligibility of the costs declared. At the end 
of the project, the monitoring experts complete an overall evaluation of the 
project’s results, including a final “score”. However, these monitoring 
arrangements focused at project level are of little use to draw lessons on the 
performance of the programme. This is because the programme’s performance 
monitoring framework does not have adequate common output and result 
indicators. In particular, the set of common output indicators introduced in 2007 
is largely limited to communication and dissemination actions such as 
workshops, seminars, conferences and publications. Furthermore, the 
Commission has not defined any result indicator. Consequently, the current 
framework does not allow the information from individual project results to be 
aggregated in a meaningful way. This prevents the regular monitoring of the 
programme’s effectiveness and the timely identification of problems affecting its 
performance.
33.	The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the development, 
updating and implementation of EU environmental policy and legislation. That 
requires that successful projects are sustained, their results disseminated and 
ultimately replicated. However, once the projects are closed, the Commission 
considers that its available resources do not allow it to perform systematic ex-
post visits to follow-up the “after-LIFE” evolution of the projects. 
34.	Aware of these weaknesses, the Commission has, since 2009, included in 
the contract between the European Commission and the monitoring team a 
requirement for ten ex-post visits per year, to examine sustainability and other 
issues . By December 2012, 30 LIFE Environment projects had been visited. 
Although this represents an improvement, it represents only 5 % of closed 
projects.
35.	When evaluating the final project report, the monitoring team establishes a 
set of long term monitoring indicators to be used during ex-post visits. 
However, the audit has not found any evidence that these indicators are 
assessed in subsequent ex-post visits. Moreover, the proposed long term 
indicators are unique to each project, which would limit their usefulness, even if 
a value would be available, at programme level. A further weakness in the 
recently introduced ex-post checks is that, even if a project’s sustainability is 
comprehensively analysed by the ex-post evaluations, the monitoring team is 
not asked to analyse the project's replication, which is fundamental to achieving 
the catalytic effect of the programme.
36.	Furthermore, as is the case during the implementation of the projects,  
neither the Commission nor the monitoring team have considered preparing a 
list of common indicators to be used by the monitoring team during the ex-post 
visits in order to follow-up the outcomes of the LIFE Environment projects. The 
combination of the above weaknesses means that the Commission lacks 
information on the number of successfully completed projects, the number of 
projects that are still operational after a certain number of years, and the 
number of projects that have been replicated. This prevents the opportunity to 
benefit from lessons learned in the past and thereby improve selection and 
monitoring procedures, avoid the repetition of errors and save resources.
37.	Although the Commission organises periodic evaluations of the programme, 
these cannot replace day to day monitoring of the programme. In fact, both 
processes are complementary, since evaluations should use, among other 
sources, the information produced for monitoring. 
38.	Overall, the audit found that the lack of consolidated information and 
appropriate indicators regarding the outputs and results of the LIFE 
Environment projects prevents the ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of 
the programme and hinders the timely identification of problems affecting 
programme implementation, which in turns hinders learning lessons for the 
future. 
Part II – Implementation 
39.	Taking into account the objectives of the LIFE Environment component (see 
paragraph 4 and Box 1),  the eligibility criteria defined by the Regulation and 
the Commission’s selection guidelines, the Court has considered that to act as 
catalysts and contribute to an effective programme, LIFE Environment projects 
should: 
(a)	be Innovative or Demonstrative by focusing on innovative or demonstrative 
solutions to environmental problems by developing or disseminating 
innovative techniques or methods, best practice techniques, know-how, 
etc.;
(b)	be of EU interest and contribute to the achievement of the general 
objectives of EU environmental policy by targeting a problem with 
significant importance at European level or expecting to generate results 
that would be widely applicable;
(c)	have their results disseminated to ensure that innovative technologies and 
procedures for protecting the environment are well known and widely 
applied;
(d)	be sustainable as the continued existence of the project is required for its 
successful dissemination and replication;
(e)	be replicated by other entities in order to generate a wider impact. 
Replication may imply the propagation and multiplication of the outcomes 
of the project and the generation of impacts beyond the individual project.
40.	The audit analysed, therefore, how these criteria were met in the different 
implementation phases of LIFE projects. 
Key aspects of the projects were not always appropriately assessed 
during project selection 
41.	The Court reviewed the evaluation forms of the 25 projects visited and of 
70 additional projects subject to a desk review. More concretely, the Court 
reviewed whether the evaluation of project proposals appropriately covered 
certain essential aspects for the effectiveness of the programme, such as the 
project’s innovative or demonstrative character, potential for sustainability or 
replication, and significance of the environmental problem addressed (see 
paragraph 39). The audit revealed projects where the evaluation and key 
criteria scores awarded were not sufficiently justified (see paragraph 27), but 
which were nevertheless funded:
(a)	The assessment of the innovative and demonstrative character of projects 
was not sufficiently justified in 20 % of the projects that have been the 
subject of a desk review and in 24 % of the projects visited on the spot.
-	The Court’s visit to the 25 projects found cases (see example in Box 3) 
where the level of innovation was either overrated or insufficiently 
justified, for example, where the evaluators did not take into account the 
existence of similar projects.    
Box 3 – Selection procedure: example of weaknesses in the evaluation of 
innovative and demonstrative character 
In the evaluation of a UK project, the innovative character of the project was 
considered as high even if under other criteria the evaluator stated that “the method is 
not entirely innovative in the Community”. 
When evaluating the demonstration character of the project, the evaluator questioned 
the scale of the project, as being too large. The beneficiary’s reply was that the 
technology proposed had already been tested on two smaller facilities of the company.
The audit revealed that one of these two facilities was already operating at a 
production scale, which questions the demonstrative character of the LIFE project.
(b)	The assessment of project sustainability or replication prospects was not 
sufficiently justified in 21 % of the projects that have been the subject of a 
desk review and in 12 % of the projects visited on the spot. 
-	The Court’s visit to the 25 projects found cases (see examples in Box 4) 
where evaluators did not identify the potential economic, financial or 
legal barriers that could prevent the project from being sustained or 
replicated. Indeed, the audit found cases of projects that, while 
achieving their objectives and expected results, could not be sustained 
or replicated because of these barriers , which in the Court’s view, 
could have been identified already during the selection process. Had 
these barriers been identified by the evaluators, the Commission could 
have decided not to fund the project. 
Box 4 – Selection procedure: examples of weaknesses in the evaluation of 
sustainability and replication of the project proposals
Project Sustainability prospects
In the evaluation of a Spanish proposal, the evaluators noted that there were no 
commercial plans to maintain the project and therefore they could not assess whether 
the project would be economically viable after completion and receipt of EU funding. 
However, the evaluators did not request any modifications or additional information in 
the revision of the project to ensure that the project offered the minimum guarantees of 
sustainability beyond EU funding. The evaluation of sustainability was therefore 
insufficient. 
The auditors’ visit of the project confirmed that the project was not sustained after its 
completion.
Legal barrier to project replication 
Another project in Spain, which has been completed in 2008, developed a technique 
using ozone as an alternative environmentally-friendly cleaning agent in food-
processing plants. The spreading of this technology would depend on a new European 
legislation supporting this technology, which is still not in place. 
Economic barriers to project replication
A project in France reduced the environmental impact of glass production. However, 
the long life-span of the glass furnaces (15-20 years) limits the possibility for 
replication within the beneficiary’s group of companies. Replication outside the group 
is not envisaged as the project represents an economic advantage for the group.

(c)	The assessment of EU interest was insufficiently justified in 20 % of the 
projects that have been the subject of a desk review and in 12 % of the 
projects visited on the spot. 
-	The Court’s visit to the 25 projects found cases (see example in Box 5) 
where the EU interest was either not assessed, or the assessment was 
not justified by the evaluator, for example, cases where there were 
doubts that the project results could be applied outside the immediate 
project scope. 
Box 5 – Selection procedure: example of weaknesses in the evaluation of the EU 
Interest of the project proposals
A UK proposal aimed at maintaining urban environments in three sites. In two of these, 
the proposal did not mention environmental issues. The main actions planned, and 
finally carried out, where related to the social environment, or to nature protection 
measures, rather than to address any environmental problem of significant importance 
at EU level as required by the applicable regulation.
Even if referring to one of the priorities defined in the LIFE Regulation, the proposal 
focused on very local problems and was not of EU interest.
The evaluation forms reviewed by the Court showed no evidence that this aspect had 
been assessed by the evaluator. 
The Commission’s monitoring of project implementation was insufficient 
in some respects
42.	The Court checked whether the monitoring work carried out was 
comprehensive and that the reports produced by the monitoring teams for the 
25 projects visited accurately reflected actual project implementation.  
43.	The work of the monitoring team during project implementation is focused 
on the delivery of the expected outputs and verifying that the claimed costs are 
technically justified, provided for in the project’s budget, realistic and actually 
incurred in the reporting period. The Court found that these checks are carried 
out regularly. However, the audit found problems with monitoring the 
reasonableness of costs and the sustainability and replication of projects.
44.	While the eligibility of claimed costs is checked, there is not any 
comparative analysis of the costs among similar projects, not even between 
projects in the same sector and region. The absence of such comparisons may 
lead to the acceptance of excessive costs, especially as the evaluators 
responsible for assessing the project proposals and the beneficiaries’ final 
reports are primarily technical, rather than financial experts. For example, the 
audit found that the claimed hourly staff cost of project managers for the 
23 closed projects visited varied between 10,56 euro and 164,39 euro.
45.	The analysis of the final cost structure of the 23 completed projects that 
were visited – shown in Figure 3 – indicate the importance of staff costs, which 
in the Court’s sample represented between 18,5 % to 83,5 % of the total costs 
of the project.
Figure 3 – Cost structure of the 23 completed projects
 
Source: European Court of Auditors.
46.	While there may be good reasons justifying the wide variations found in the 
hourly staff cost charged to LIFE projects, the Court nevertheless finds that 
extreme range variations justify further analysis by the Commission.
47.	The Court also found that the monitoring team does not pay sufficient 
attention to the sustainability and replication prospects of projects (see 
examples in Box 6). 
Box 6 – Examples of weaknesses in monitoring  of sustainability and replication
A project in Spain aimed at reducing groundwater contamination by reducing the use 
of fertilisers and nitric acid in a horticultural sector. 
The project received a good assessment from the monitoring team despite the fact 
that the beneficiary recognised that limited environmental benefits were obtained, and 
that further studies were needed to demonstrate environmental benefits. The 
monitoring team also noted that such studies were necessary to assure the project’s 
sustainability, although the beneficiary had not committed to undertake such studies. 
Finally, the transferability was assessed as “high” by the monitoring team, although the 
team concluded that “this sector was probably not ready to introduce technological 
changes because it has low profits and no investment can be really done by the small 
producers”. This issue was not addressed during the implementation of the project. 
At the time of the Court’s visit only one of the six partners which participated in the 
project continued using the new technology. There is no evidence that the project was 
replicated.
A project in Italy had an expected duration of 24 months. Five months before its end, 
the beneficiary requested a substantial project modification as none of the 50 potential 
users that were initially interested in product testing were still interested in the new 
process. Despite the fact such testing was initially considered as fundamental, the 
beneficiary requested the Commission’s permission to have the test performed by a 
business partner.
The Commission accepted the requested modification of the project. After its 
completion, the project was not sustained nor replicated due to the lack of interest of 
end users. Despite the evident risks that the lack of interest from end-users 
represented for the sustainability of the project, the monitoring team never questioned 
this issue and no corrective action was taken to address it.
48.	Beneficiaries prepare implementation and final reports where they present 
the project results and achievements. The monitoring teams assess these 
reports. The audit found that the monitoring teams were not sufficiently critical 
of the statements and arguments made in the beneficiaries’ implementation 
and final reports (see Box 7). As a result, there is a risk that the achievements 
of the projects, and thus of the programme are overestimated. 
Box 7 – Insufficiently critical monitoring of beneficiaries’ reports
A project in Italy aimed at the reduction of waste in the ceramics sector. The 
monitoring team’s assessment of the beneficiary’s final report substantially reflects the 
beneficiary’s own statements, and was not sufficiently critical of the project’s reported 
sustainability. The project which was finished in September 2008 (the final payment 
was done in August 2009), was not sustained at the time of the Court’s visit.
A project in Germany aimed at developing cleaner city logistics. The monitoring team’s 
evaluation of the project’s environmental benefits substantially reflects the 
beneficiary’s own statements, without further assessment.    
49.	In conclusion, the audit detected weaknesses in the assessments by the 
monitoring teams in 18 out of 25 projects examined. In addition to the lack of a 
sufficiently critical assessment of beneficiaries’ own assessments, the 
weaknesses were evenly spread over the assessment of the projects’ 
environmental objectives, sustainability, replication and dissemination. 
Low dissemination, sustainability, and replication of projects jeopardised 
the “catalytic” role expected from the programme
50.	One of the LIFE programme’s key objectives is that it should act as a 
catalyst for developing environmental policy and actions. A necessary condition 
for this is that projects’ results are appropriately and widely disseminated, 
sustained and replicated (see paragraph 39). 
51.	The sample of projects audited point to problems with all of these elements 
(see Annex II). Even when projects achieved positive environmental results, 
the programme failed to effectively disseminate and replicate them effectively in 
order to translate those small scale results into a more meaningful application 
at EU level. This significantly limits the overall effectiveness of the programme.
Dissemination of results 
52.	As indicated in paragraph 39 and Figure 2, the dissemination of project 
results is required if projects are to serve as catalysts for environmental action. 
Effective dissemination encourages the replication and development of project 
results. It should be well targeted, efficiently delivered, and monitored. The 
responsibility for disseminating LIFE project results is shared between the 
Commission and the beneficiaries. The audit found problems with both. 
53.	The Commission publishes significant LIFE project information on its 
website. This includes summaries of project themes and lessons learned, a 
project database, a “LIFE by Theme” tool, and project summaries. Thematic 
platform meetings are promoted by the Commission or by Member States or 
individual beneficiaries, and closing conferences are organised by a significant 
number of projects.
54.	However, once projects are completed, no update is made by the 
Commission to reflect either problems or successes concerning the results, 
sustainability or replication of the projects. Moreover, the partially manual 
treatment of the information, and the lack of Commission resources lead to 
information gaps and errors. For example, 11 out of the 23 closed projects 
visited were not included by the Commission in the “LIFE by Theme” tool. This 
means that, despite extensive on line information, potential users do not have 
access to complete and up to date project information.
55.	The LIFE Common Provisions require the beneficiary, as part of the 
communication actions, to create or use an existing website for the 
dissemination of project activities, progress and results. For LIFE projects 
approved before 2007 there was no mandatory period for keeping the site 
operational. For sixteen  out of 22 of these closed projects that were visited by 
the audit, the website was operational. For LIFE projects approved from 2007 
the website has to be online within six months after the start of the project and 
has to be regularly updated and maintained for at least five years after the end 
of the project. The projects audited from this period complied with this 
requirement. 
56.	Although the Commission has made efforts to stimulate improvements in 
project websites (such as posting examples of websites on the LIFE website 
and providing recommendations on how to design LIFE project websites given 
to the selected projects), the audit found weaknesses in the websites reviewed.
57.	The audit analysed the content of 63 project websites  from the sample of 
69  projects. This included 31 LIFE projects approved before 2007, and 
32 LIFE projects approved thereafter. Of the 53 operational websites that were 
operational at the time of the audit, 11 had very limited content. The main 
weaknesses were very brief project descriptions, and lack of visual aids, 
reports, and presentations. However there was an improvement in the quality of 
the websites of projects approved after 2007.
58.	In addition to passive communication using the internet or other forms of 
publicity, dissemination activities should be tailored to the specific 
circumstances of the project. The audit found cases where, despite projects 
delivering their intended results, dissemination activities were ineffective and 
failed to encourage project replication. Project websites were not updated, 
dissemination was largely in the context of the beneficiaries’ commercial 
advertising campaigns, or to direct business partners and activities planned as 
part of agreed “after-LIFE” communication plans were not completed.  
59.	For project beneficiaries which are private companies, dissemination 
activities are generally organised in the context of the commercialisation of the 
product. This was done to protect know-how as the project was often 
considered as a strategic advantage for the beneficiary companies. However, 
this limits the effectiveness of the dissemination pursued by the programme. 
LIFE results would give the company a competitive advantage in the industry. 
Therefore, it may not be in the interests of the company to transfer the 
knowledge and replicate the project out of the group to which it belongs. This 
significantly reduces the eventual environmental impact of the project. The 
question arises as to whether the LIFE programme should fund such projects.
60.	In conclusion, the Court found that the dissemination activities undertaken 
did not sufficiently encourage the replication of project results. Even when 
beneficiaries completed the dissemination activities required under the project 
agreement, there was a lack of coordinated dissemination activities between 
the Commission, beneficiaries, and competent national authorities to effectively 
encourage replication of project results.
61.	 Box 8 gives such an example of a successful project, whose potential for 
significant environmental impact was not achieved due to ineffective 
dissemination.  
Box 8 – Catalytic impact for the ceramic sector not achieved
The polishing of ceramic and related materials produces large quantities of waste. One 
of the projects visited in Italy successfully implemented a process to reduce and 
recycle this waste. 
The project, finished in 2008, was still operational at the time of the audit visit in 2013. 
Despite the success and sustainability of the project it has not been replicated. The 
project’s website has not been updated since its completion but the company, 
considering the project as a very positive marketing aspect, includes the LIFE logo in 
all its promotional items.
An important part of this production is concentrated in a limited number of European 
regions, in particular the ceramic district of Sassuolo in Italy and the Valencia region in 
Spain.
Although the beneficiary completed the dissemination activities required under the 
project agreement, there has not been a coordinated effort between the Commission, 
the regional authorities and the business organisations to disseminate project results 
and encourage the use of similar techniques elsewhere. The environmental impact is 
therefore significantly reduced.
Project sustainability and replication of results
62.	As indicated in paragraph 39, the sustainability of LIFE Environment 
projects is essential for the programme’s effectiveness, although to some 
extent the innovative and demonstrative character required for LIFE projects 
implies a risk of failure. The audit visited 23 completed projects, most of them 
completed between 2007 and 2009. The audit found that ten out of these were 
no longer operational at the time of the visit. For two projects, beneficiaries or 
partners were conducting new developments. Examples of unsustainable 
projects were given in Boxes 4 and 6, and an example of a sustainable project 
was given in Box 8. 
63.	The weaknesses in the dissemination of successful project results explain, 
at least partially the low replication of projects. Only eight of the 23 completed 
projects visited have been or are likely to be replicated, including three that are 
no longer operational. For two projects out of the eight, replication is done 
within the group of companies to which the beneficiary belongs, limiting the 
replication and EU added value. This demonstrates the difference between 
successful project completion, and programme effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
64.	The LIFE Environment programme should serve as a catalyst for EU 
environmental policy, essentially through the funding of innovative or 
demonstrative projects with European added value and the subsequent 
dissemination and replication of their results. The audit assessed the 
effectiveness of this catalytic effect.
65.	The Court concluded that the LIFE Environment component was not 
operating effectively because it was not sufficiently well designed and 
implemented. The audit identified design and implementation weaknesses, 
which significantly reduced the programme’s fundamental catalytic role to boost 
meaningful developments in EU environmental policy. Without this, the overall 
effectiveness of the programme cannot be achieved. 
66.	The lack of a mechanism to target scarce resources on pre-selected 
objectives dissipated the impact of the invested funds (paragraphs 13 to 16).

Recommendation 1
In the establishment of the multi-annual work programmes foreseen in the new LIFE 
programme, the legislative authorities should enable the Commission and the Member 
States to restrict eligible applications to limited strategic priorities, and to set clear, 
specific, measurable and achievable objectives for projects to be funded. 
A limited number of priorities fixed for a number of years would streamline the 
selection process, concentrate the efforts on specific issues and facilitate the 
evaluation of the programme impact.
67.	The indicative national allocations hampered the selection of best projects 
because projects were not only selected based on their merit but also on their 
Member State of origin (paragraphs 17 to 21).
Recommendation 2 
The Commission’s proposal for the new LIFE programme ends the national allocation 
for traditional projects but keeps a geographical balance for Integrated projects. In its 
application, the Commission should ensure that Integrated projects are selected based 
on their merit, and that geographical balance should not breach the principle of equal 
opportunities for applicants.
68.	The quality of the project selection was adversely influenced by the 
inappropriate justification of evaluation results (paragraphs 22 to 28).
Recommendation 3
The Commission should improve the project selection evaluation forms and require the 
evaluators to provide separate assessments and scores for major project aspects 
(such as innovative or demonstrative character of the proposal, the quality of the 
dissemination actions planned, or the potential for the replication of results), in order to 
improve the quality and transparency of the selection process and to ensure that 
selected projects have the potential to contribute most towards the achievement of the 
programme objectives.
69.	The monitoring framework of the programme lacked appropriate common 
output and result indicators. This prevented the Commission from getting a 
comprehensive and updated overview of the performance of projects, and 
therefore from getting information on the effectiveness of the programme 
(paragraphs 29 to 38).
Recommendation 4
The Commission should improve its programme management tools and consider 
introducing adequate common output and result indicators as well as follow-up 
information at project level, in order to facilitate an appropriate monitoring of the 
programme. To the extent possible, such indicators should be relevant, accepted, 
credible, easy and robust (“RACER” criteria). 
70.	Key aspects of the projects, concerning their innovative and demonstrative 
character, their sustainability, and EU interest, were not appropriately assessed 
during project selection (paragraph 41) (see Recommendation 3).
71.	The monitoring of the reasonableness of project costs, their sustainability 
and replication were insufficient (paragraphs 42 to 49).
Recommendation 5
The Commission should improve its assessment of the reasonableness of claimed 
personnel costs, particularly for comparable projects, by making better use of 
information collected during the monitoring phase. This could then be better used to 
facilitate the identification of excessive costs. 
72.	The Court found examples of ineffective dissemination, low sustainability 
and replication of projects. The potential role of the Environment component as 
a catalyst for environmental policy was therefore greatly reduced 
(paragraphs 50 to 63).

Recommendation 6
The Commission should increase its focus on dissemination, sustainability and 
replication of LIFE projects. In particular, the Commission should:   
(a)	 Require the monitoring team to include in its assessments a critical analysis of the 
dissemination, sustainability and replication measures proposed by the beneficiary and 
of the potential barriers that might hinder them, both in its evaluation reports during the 
project implementation as well as in its ex-post visit reports. 
(b) Consider how to better encourage the dissemination and replication of project 
results by private beneficiaries who wish to protect their commercial interests.
(c) Consider how to require the beneficiaries to electronically submit simple and 
updated information after the project completion (i.e. whether the project remains 
operational, whether the project is replicated, and if yes, how many times, ...). This 
would enable the Commission to efficiently improve its ex-post information on the 
programme effectiveness.

the Court of Auditors, in Luxembourg at its meeting of 6 November 2013.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	The External Borders Fund (EBF) is the main EU financial instrument in 
support of external border management, amounting to 1,9 billion euro for the 
2007-2013 period. The EBF’s overall aim is to help current and prospective 
Schengen States to ensure uniform, effective and efficient controls at their 
common external borders. 
II.	The Court’s audit focussed on processes related to the EBF’s effectiveness, 
EU added value and the achievement of the objectives of programmes and 
projects. It examined the design, programming and implementation as well as 
the monitoring and evaluation.
III.	The audit showed that the EBF has contributed to external border 
management and that it has fostered financial solidarity. However further EU 
added value was limited and the overall result could not be measured due to 
weaknesses in the Responsible Authorities’ monitoring and serious deficiencies 
in the ex post evaluations by the Commission and the Member States. 
IV.	Member States’ programmes were not embedded in national strategies for 
border control and visas and lacked SMART objectives and measurable 
indicators. Project selection procedures did not ensure that the actual needs of 
the Member States were met and inadequate procurement procedures in 
Member States put sound financial management at risk.
V.	The audit found serious weaknesses in management of the Fund in key 
Member States (Greece, Spain, Italy and, for the early funding years, Malta). 
Low implementation in some countries limited the Fund’s effectiveness. These 
weaknesses lead to the risk that border management is not adequately 
strengthened where it is most needed.
VI.	The Court focuses its recommendation in four areas:
(a)	Ensuring the availability of information on overall results
Member States should set measurable targets for output, outcome and, where 
possible, impact indicators and indicators should be recorded from the start of 
the programme using appropriate IT systems. The Commission should ensure 
that its evaluation report presents stakeholders with an informed and timely 
analysis of underlying data.
(b)	Increasing the EU added value of the Fund
The Commission should provide Frontex with relevant, comprehensive and 
timely information regarding implementation of the EBF, the Internal Security 
Fund and subsequent instruments. The recording of co-financed assets in 
Frontex’s equipment pool should be made obligatory for those assets which 
might be useful to its needs. Furthermore, Member States and the Commission 
should concentrate more on establishing Common Application Centres and 
other forms of consular cooperation rather than the renovation, adaptation or 
equipping of consulates. 
(c)	Embedding the EBF in a national strategy for border management
Member States should develop comprehensive national strategies on border 
management based on a risk analysis following the Common Integrated Risk 
Analysis Model and this should be an ex ante condition to receive support from 
the Internal Security Fund or subsequent instruments.
(d)	Strengthening the implementation of the Fund 
Administrative capacity, including in respect of procurement, should be 
strengthened, particularly in key Member States.


INTRODUCTION
The External Borders Fund
1.	The External Borders Fund (EBF) is the main European Union (EU) 
financial instrument in support of external border management, amounting to 
1,9 billion euro for the 2007-2013 period . Its overall aim is to help current and 
prospective Schengen States to ensure uniform, effective and efficient controls 
at the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. 
2.	Within the Schengen area, internal controls have been abolished with the 
consequence that external border security of any one state affects all of the 
others. Due to the countries’ differing geographical situations, the 
responsibilities for border controls vary considerably. The EBF aims to 
establish financial solidarity between Member States  by supporting those for 
which the control of the EU’s external borders represents a heavy burden.
3.	There are currently 28 Member States implementing the EBF (see 
Figure 1). All EU Member States except for the UK, Ireland and Croatia 
participate in the EBF .


Figure 1 ? Countries participating in the EBF

4.	The general aims of the EBF are to support:
(a)	an efficient organisation of border controls,
(b)	an efficient management of the flows of persons at the external borders, in 
conformity with the Schengen acquis and the principles of respectful 
treatment and dignity,
(c)	a uniform application of the relevant EU legislation, and
(d)	the improvement of Member States’ consular services in third countries as 
regards the flows of third-country nationals into the territory of the Member 
States and the cooperation between Member States in this regard. 
5.	The EBF’s contribution to external border management is to be achieved by 
focussing on five priorities (Figure 2). These have been defined by the 
Commission in the “Strategic Guidelines” . Member States have to address at 
least three of them in their EBF multi-annual programmes. Within each of the 
five priorities, the Commission has identified a number of areas with particular 
importance to the EU (“specific priorities”) and for which the Member States 
can receive a higher EBF co-financing rate (see paragraph 9).

6.	Expenditure by priority for 2007-2010 is shown in Figure 3. Based on the 
Member States’ plans for 2011-2013, the allocation for priority 1 is expected to 
increase to 37 % while the allocation for priority 2 is expected to decrease to 
36 %, the other priorities remaining stable.

1 The latest available final expenditure data concern the annual programme 2010. Due 
to the 2,5 year eligibility period, funds from this annual programme could be spent up 
until the end of June 2012 and had to be subsequently verified by Member States and 
the Commission. Reports on later annual programmes have not been finalised yet.
Source: European Commission.
7.	The measures funded by the EBF include investment in infrastructure at 
border crossing points; purchase of equipment for intervention at borders (such 
as vehicles, boats and aircraft); cooperation initiatives in the field of consular 
services; investment in the Schengen Information System (SIS) and Visa 
Information System (VIS), staff training, pilot projects and studies.
8.	Under the EBF 7,3 % has been set aside for Community Actions, which 
mainly support cooperation between Member States, Emergency Actions (as 
part of the Community Actions) and Specific Actions which address 
weaknesses at strategic border points.
9.	The EBF’s basic contribution is 50 % of the total cost of actions or 75 % for 
actions in Cohesion Fund countries or in “specific priority” areas, rising to 80 % 
for Specific Actions and 90 % for Community and Emergency Actions. 
10.	Table 1 shows the allocations to national programmes, per Member State, 
and to Community, Emergency and Specific actions. The share of the biggest 
EBF recipients is illustrated in Figure 4.

The EBF in context
11.	Most expenditure related to external border management is funded 
nationally . Member States are responsible for the management of their 
external borders, applying the common rules established in the Schengen 
acquis. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation 
at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) 
coordinates cooperation between Member States and provides risk analyses 
and training. Thus the EBF is one piece of the jigsaw in the area of external 
border management (see Figure 5).
12.	The EBF is part of the “General programme on Solidarity and Management 
of Migration Flows for the period 2007–2013” (SOLID programme) managed by 
the Home Affairs DG. The SOLID programme is designed to improve the 
management of migratory flows at EU level and to help share the financial 
burden resulting from the integrated management of common external borders 
and implementation of common policies on immigration and asylum .

13.	External factors, such as the recent upheavals in North Africa together with 
ongoing political and economic crises in other parts of the world, have resulted 
in massive migrant streams which have put considerable pressure on the EU’s 
external borders. Search and rescue operations are not among the EBF’s 
priorities, however in the course of border surveillance patrols EBF co-financed 
equipment can be (and has been) used for saving lives at sea. 
Roles and responsibilities
14.	The EBF is mainly implemented through shared management . According 
to this principle, the Member States are responsible for the implementation 
(operational and financial) of the funded actions while the Commission remains 
responsible for overall budget execution. The Commission adopts strategic 
guidelines setting out the EU programming framework. Each participating 
Member State prepares a multi-annual programme applying these strategic 
guidelines on the basis of its own needs.
15.	The multi-annual programme is implemented through annual programmes. 
Both are subject to the Commission’s approval. Member States submit final 
reports after the completion of each annual programme.
16.	The Commission is also responsible for ensuring that the Member States 
have set up adequate management and control systems, that appropriate 
information, publicity and follow-up is provided for the funded projects and that 
actions are consistent with, and complementary to, other relevant Union 
policies and initiatives.
17.	Member States’ implementation is monitored by the Commission through 
desk-reviews of management and control systems descriptions and of progress 
and final reports and by audit and monitoring visits.
18.	At Member State level, the management and control system comprises :
(a)	The Responsible Authority (RA), responsible for managing and 
implementing the multi-annual programme. In particular, it submits multi-
annual and annual programmes to the Commission, selects operations and 
verifies the eligibility of the expenditure claimed by the final beneficiaries .
(b)	The Audit Authority (AA) performs audits to verify the functioning of the 
management and control systems . 
(c)	The Certifying Authority (CA) certifies that the expenditure declared 
complies with the applicable rules .
19.	The national co-financing can be subject to national control and audit 
depending on the Member State’s administrative procedures. 



AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH 
20.	The main audit question was to assess whether the EBF has contributed 
effectively to external border management. This has been broken down into the 
following sub-questions: 
(a)	Have the programmes and projects effectively supported the EBF’s 
priorities in external border management? 
(b)	Has the EBF provided financial solidarity between Member States, 
addressed the Fund’s specific priorities and thereby delivered EU added 
value? 
(c)	Have the EBF’s programming and implementation procedures contributed 
to the Fund’s effectiveness?
(d)	Are the Member States and the Commission using monitoring and 
evaluation appropriately to improve the effectiveness of the EBF? 
21.	The audit covered:
(a)	the shared management parts of the EBF managed and implemented by 
Member States and
(b)	the Community Actions (including Emergency Actions) and Specific 
Actions directly managed by the Commission and implemented by Member 
States.
22.	The audit focused on processes related to the EBF’s effectiveness, EU 
added value and the achievement of the objectives of projects and 
programmes. It sought to examine the design, programming and 
implementation as well as monitoring and evaluation of EBF funded measures. 
The audit did not perform a detailed analysis of the management and control 
systems in the Member States , nor did it undertake a direct measurement of 
impact achieved through EBF funded measures but based its assessment on 
monitoring and evaluation data of Member States and the Commission. 
23.	The audit was based on: 
(a)	a documentary review of the multiannual and annual programmes final 
reports (covering 2007-2010 programmes) and contributions to evaluations 
of five selected Member States ; Commission reports on allocation of 
resources, the Commission’s intermediate report on results achieved and 
its draft ex post evaluation; Council documents and selected Frontex 
studies and documents;
(b)	interviews and collection of information on-the-spot at the level of the 
Commission, the Responsible Authorities and final beneficiaries in the five 
selected Member States. Interviews were also conducted with other 
stakeholders such as the Council in the case of the Schengen 
evaluations , Frontex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights;
(c)	on-the-spot visits to 31 completed projects in the selected Member States 
based on a judgmental (non-random) sample (see Annex) covering annual 
programmes from 2007-2010;
(d)	a desk-review of seven completed projects  directly managed by the 
Commission based on a judgmental (non-random) sample covering annual 
work programmes from 2007-2011 (see Annex);
(e)	a separate audit  that took place in one of the selected Member States 
(Spain) that touched on the EBF.
24.	The audit was carried out against the background of the Commission’s 
proposals for the 2014-2020 funding period which will create the Internal 
Security Fund as a successor to the EBF  providing for financial support for 
the management of external borders and visas. The proposals will involve 
changes in both content and the management and control system. Where 
relevant, these proposals were taken into account in this audit.


OBSERVATIONS
25.	The Court presents its main audit findings in four sections. The first section 
shows that the EBF has contributed to external border management but the 
overall result could not be measured. The second section focuses on the EBF 
fostering financial solidarity and its EU added value. Programming and 
implementation are discussed in the third section. Finally, monitoring and 
evaluation are dealt with in the fourth section. 
The EBF has contributed to external border management, but the overall 
result could not be measured and low implementation in some Member 
States limits impact
Programmes and projects geared towards the EBF’s priorities but the 
overall result could not be measured
26.	Multi-annual programmes and annual programmes in the five selected 
Member States were generally in line with, and contributed to, all five EBF 
priorities (Figure 2). However, given the weaknesses in the monitoring in these 
Member States and serious deficiencies in the ex post evaluations (see 
paragraphs 71 to 73) at both Member State and Commission level, it was not 
possible for the Court to make an adequate assessment of the Fund’s overall 
achievements. 
27.	Most audited projects supported the achievement of the EBF’s priorities. 
Out of 31 projects audited on the spot (see Annex) in the five selected Member 
States, five supported the EBF priorities only partially (because they included 
project expenditure which was ineligible  or relevance of that expenditure to 
the EBF  could not be determined) . One further project’s  contribution to 
achieving the priorities went against the EBF’s aims  by not complying with the 
principle of respectful treatment and dignity (see paragraph 60). 
28.	Most projects achieved their intended output but measurable targets and 
indicators were not set (see paragraphs 52 to 54) and reports did not 
adequately demonstrate the outcome and impact achieved (see Figure 6 for 
examples of output, outcome and impact indicators).

referred to as outcomes. 
Low implementation in some Member States
29.	The average implementation rate of the EBF national programmes 2007-
2010 was 87,6 %. However problems existed in a small number of Member 
States (Figure 7). In particular this is the case in Greece where planning and 
implementation failed to the extent that only 43 % of its EBF allocation was 
implemented .

evaluation on both closed programmes and, where programmes were not closed, on

programme implementation. The implementation rates for Cyprus and the Czech 
Republic were not final. Denmark did not provide implementation rates for total budget. 
No data for Switzerland and Luxembourg. The Greek figure is based on the final 
reports of its annual programmes.

Whilst the EBF has fostered financial solidarity, further EU added value 
has been limited
30.	The Court sought to establish whether the EBF’s aim of fostering financial 
solidarity was achieved. It also sought evidence that  the EBF delivered further 
EU added value, notably by targeting the specific priorities (see Figure 2), 
supporting cooperation between Member States or by being directed at the 
most urgent problems.
31.	The EBF allocations clearly helped to spread the Member States financial 
burden caused by the introduction of the Union’s integrated management of 
common external borders. Member States having a higher relative burden 
receive higher EBF aid (see Figure 4). However, the Court found that the 
EBF’s further EU added value was limited due to: 
(a)	a partially ineffective system for reinforcing specific priorities, 
(b)	 little support of operational cooperation between Member States,
(c)	ill-designed mechanisms for responding to specific weaknesses at strategic 
border points and partially effective mechanisms to respond to 
emergencies, and 
(d)	the support of programmes and projects which would have been financed 
nationally in any case, lacking a proper needs assessment or containing 
significant ineligible costs in some of the projects audited.

Partially ineffective system for reinforcing specific priorities
32.	The Commission has drawn up strategic guidelines to define priorities, 
complemented by specific priorities for implementing the EBF in the Member 
States which have EU added value and to provide incentives therefor. Projects 
supporting specific priorities such as SIS, VIS (Box 1), consular cooperation 
and EUROSUR were eligible for a higher co-financing rate. However, this 
incentive (75 % instead of the standard 50 %) is ineffective in the 15 Cohesion 
Fund countries  (which account for approximately 60 % of EBF allocation) 
because they receive 75 % co-financing anyway. Some Member States (Spain 
and Malta) confirmed that specific priorities were not a factor in designing their 
programmes.
33.	In addition, three out of 12 specific priorities had not been clearly formulated 
by the Commission  or lacked practicality, further limiting their ability to deliver 
EU added value. Since the 2011 annual programmes, the Commission has 
tried to focus EBF funding on specific priorities but, due to a lack of monitoring, 
there is no evidence that this has increased their use. 
34.	However, due to the lack of a system for monitoring the use of specific 
priorities and a reliable and adequate ex post evaluation at Commission level, 
the full extent of support for actions with “high” EU added value could not be 
determined by the Court.
Box 1 – EBF contribution to SIS II and VIS
Despite the lack of monitoring the Court found evidence of the EBF’s contribution to 
the specific priorities establishing the SIS II and VIS IT systems. During its on-the-spot 
visits to such projects the Court found that EBF support was deemed to be crucial to 
the development of the national systems . However, the delays and changes in IT 
systems at EU level  impacted on the EBF’s efficiency and effectiveness since 
amendments had to be carried out and equipment purchased could not be used .

Little support of operational cooperation between Member States
35.	In two specific areas where the EBF was intended to support cooperation 
between Member States, namely consular cooperation and Frontex operations, 
limited results were achieved. 
36.	The goal of the EBF (within its priority 3) to fund the development of 
consular cooperation, and Common Application Centres in particular, has only 
been achieved to a limited extent despite the 90 % co-financing rates available 
under Community Actions. Only two Common Applications Centres were 
funded (see Box 2 for one example) and only one Member State (France) 
planned a consular cooperation project through other forms of cooperation 
(such as colocation or outsourcing). Instead, Member States  used the EBF to 
renovate, adapt and equip their own national consulates - sometimes in the 
same countries. The use of the EBF in such a manner failed to exploit 
economies of scale and benefit from cooperation between Member States to 
improve visa application procedures and prevent visa fraud. 
Box 2 - “Maison Schengen” Common Applications Centre in Kinshasa, 
Democratic Republic of Congo
Financed by two Community Action projects (2007 and 2009, total EBF funding 
845 704 euro), the Belgian-Portuguese initiative’s aim was to create the first Schengen 
Common Visa Application Centre. Each participating Member State remains 
responsible for the back office processing. However, the application processes are 
centralised allowing multiple Member States to pool and share resources. This 
centralisation supports better, more efficient and more humane reception of visa 
applicants and the fight against ‘visa shopping’  and fraud. At the end of 2013, the 
Centre represented 17 Schengen States.
37.	The second area of cooperation where the EBF had only a limited impact is 
the support of operations coordinated by Frontex through the increase in 
the number of assets at its disposal. The strategic guidelines contain a 
specific priority which was designed to reinforce Frontex’s operational capacity. 
However, as with other specific priorities, the incentive mechanism had little 
effect (see paragraph 32) and its results have not been measured.
38.	The Court verified whether EBF co-financed assets were recorded in the 
Frontex equipment pool. This would support Frontex in its planning and 
implementation of (Joint) operations (Box 3). Even though many EBF co-
financed assets would be suitable for Frontex missions, there is no legal 
obligation to record EBF co-financed equipment in the equipment pool. The 
Court found that only two out of a sample of 16 aircraft and patrol vessels were 
so recorded. This limits Frontex’s ability to plan and implement (Joint) 
operations
39.	Moreover, in spite of the Commission’s legal obligation and Frontex’s 
requests, Frontex did not receive any information from the Commission on the 
implementation of the Fund (such as assets purchased) until June 2013, 
thereby further limiting its planning and operational ability and its checks to 
prevent double-financing of operational costs. 
Box 3 - Example of good practice putting assets at the disposal of Frontex 
operations 
The two assets in the Court’s sample registered in Frontex’ equipment pool were 
aircraft of the Armed Forces of Malta. 
Despite facing regular migration pressure itself, Malta made one of its EBF procured 
surveillance aircraft available for 90 hours for a specific Frontex Joint Operation in 
Spain in October 2012.

40.	For the period 2014-2020, the Commission has proposed to incentivise only 
two priorities of national programmes, by increasing EU co-financing to 90 % 
and by providing additional funding. Specific actions are abolished. The 
priorities to be incentivised are the ones where the Court found limited EU 
added value, namely consular cooperation and the Fund’s contribution to 
Frontex operations. While an enhanced involvement of Frontex is planned in 
the Fund’s management, comprehensive information exchange between the 
Agency and the Commission in both shared and direct management 
programme implementation is not envisaged. In addition, there is still no 
general obligation that EBF funded assets should be entered into the Frontex 
technical equipment pool.
EBF mechanism to address specific weaknesses at strategic border 
points and emergency mechanism were partially effective
41.	One element of the EBF’s potential EU added value is its ability to be 
directed at the most urgent problems, which are typically the most threatened 
border areas or general emergency situations. In order to judge the 
effectiveness of the EBF’s mechanism to respond to emergencies and to 
address specific weaknesses at strategic border points, the Court examined the 
relevant funding streams of the EBF. The audit showed that the Specific 
actions were used as a simple “top-up” for the Member States’ annual 
programmes. The Member States and the Commission failed to ensure 
coordination between these different parts of the EBF, resulting in a loss of an 
overview of which project is funded, where and why.
42.	Furthermore, the Court found that part of the Emergency Actions were used 
for non-emergency situations or were poorly managed (see Box 4). 
Box 4 – Partially effective system of funding for emergencies at the external 
borders
Case 1: Supporting actions which were not emergencies
The 2011 Emergency Actions were entirely used for eight projects totalling about 
7,5 million euro to support Member States in their final stages of SIS II development, 
even though that project had begun in 2001. Moreover in one case the expenditure 
had already been financed by the Member State. 
Case 2: Example of poor management of emergency projects
The 2010 Emergency Actions consisted of three projects granted to Italy for about 
4 million euro to deal with the migration inflow due to the Arab spring of which the 
Court audited two. One of these projects was to fund internal transportation of 
migrants . Its application did not contain any reference to the number of migrants that 
could be transported, making assessment of value for money impossible. The actual 
number of migrants transported was not reported and was only submitted after a 
specific request from the Commission, without information on the transportation time 
targets set or any other details which would enable the project to be evaluated. In 
addition, only half of the project budget was implemented and no reasons for this were 
given in the project’s final report. The other audited project  also suffered from lack of 
quantifiable targets and appropriate reporting.
43.	Under the EBF 10 million euro was available annually for projects 
addressing specific weaknesses at strategic border points. These Specific 
Actions were not included in the Commission’s EBF proposal but inserted by 
the Council. The procedure to select the projects was lengthy and the 
implementation period (six months) was far too short for projects involving 
procurement of specialised equipment such as helicopters, resulting in a low 
implementation rate. Greece, for example, despite its needs, was not able to 
implement nine out of 11 approved projects under 2008-2010 Specific Action 
programmes. Of the two Italian Specific Action projects audited in detail, the 
Court found that some elements were used outside the border areas and 
others were completely outside the EBF’s scope (see Box 5).
44.	Given these inherent design restrictions in the legislation and the 
implementation problems, the Commission took the decision not to carry out 
any Specific Actions in 2013. 
Box 5 - Specific Actions used outside the border area
The Court examined one project from the 2009 Specific Actions and one from 2010. 
Both were implemented by the Italian Ministry of the Interior, the end user of the 
equipment being the police.
2009 Specific Actions: Six months rental of vehicles to be used at the Italian 
southern maritime borders 
The project responded to the call for tenders which specified the territorial scope as 
“the maritime border of Italy (Mediterranean sea and Sicilian sea)”. The grant 
application stated that the project would “increase the effectiveness of surveillance 
activity in the ports area and coastline of Central Mediterranean region”. However all 
137 cars were delivered to C.I.E. (Identification and Expulsion Centre) located as far 
north as Turin, Milan and Bologna and were not involved in surveillance of the external 
border. The Commission nevertheless approved the costs (final grant amount 
950 688 euro).
2010 Specific Actions: Border Patrolling 
The project planned to purchase police vehicles (the application is inconsistent as to 
how many cars should be purchased and their use) for patrolling the maritime borders 
in the south of Italy and especially the south-western coastline. However the vehicles 
were used close to the C.I.E.  and C.A.R.A. (Asylum and Refugee Centre). In the 
evaluation of the final report the Commission noted that the allocation of 22 of 
43 vehicles purchased under the project was not in line with the territorial scope of the 
call for proposals as they were used (as above) in/around C.I.E and C.A.R.A. The 
related costs (337 405 euro) were subsequently considered ineligible by the 
Commission (final grant amount 560 259 euro out of 1 192 559 euro approved).

Support for projects which would have been financed nationally in any 
case, lacking a proper needs assessment or containing significant 
ineligible costs
45.	The Court found that, in  two of the five Member States in the Court’s 
sample (Greece and Spain), many projects had already been financed, or 
would have been financed, nationally in any case at the time they were 
included in the annual programmes. This was also the case for one of the three 
audited Emergency Actions where the project application already stated that 
the Member State had set the budget aside to fully finance it. Although the 
Fund’s rules allow this practice and it increases the implementation rate, the 
replacement of national expenditure of a Member State by EU funds would put 
at risk any EU added value. In the cases identified above there was no EU 
added value.
46.	In three Member States in the Court’s sample (Greece, Italy and Poland) 
the EU added value of certain projects could not be established due to the lack 
of an adequate assessment of the needs the projects aimed to address. In two 
Member States (Greece and Italy), the Fund had limited EU added value since 
some projects consisted of operating support such as fuel and consumables for 
equipment rather than building the Member States capacity in external border 
management. While support for such costs is permitted and might be justified in 
emergency situations, the Fund is intended to support principally the building of 
capacity , e.g. through infrastructure or procurement of equipment, not to 
finance running costs. 
47.	The EU added value of the EBF is further limited by the high amount of 
ineligible costs in some of the projects audited, resulting from expenses that 
are not in line with the Fund’s priorities or from equipment not working or 
operating as or where it should. In most cases found by the Court, these 
irregularities were not detected by the  national management and control 
systems in place (for examples relative to paragraphs 45 to 47 see Box 6).
Box 6 - Examples of projects with low or unknown EU added value 
Funding projects already financed
A Greek project to procure 75 police patrol and passenger vehicles was included in a 
revision to Greece’s 2009 annual programme in March 2011, after the vehicles had 
been acquired and financed from the national budget.
Lack of needs assessment and ineligible costs
In Italy, the Court audited a project (2010 annual programme) procuring 
355 operational vehicles for the Guardia di Finanza for their tasks on the detection and 
identification of immigrants at sea borders. The final beneficiary could not fully 
demonstrate how the number of vehicles needed was determined or on what basis 
they had been allocated to the different units. The numbers bought under the project 
increased primarily due to extra funds being available. The Court found cars are also 
used for “regular” police work.
In view of the lack of a needs assessment for the 355 vehicles and the fact that Italy 
purchased a total of 1 084 vehicles under the 2007-2010 annual programmes, there is 
a risk that EBF financing is spent on projects not responding to EBF priorities and that 
urgent needs are not met.
In another Italian project which was set up to extend software and fibre optic cable 
infrastructure between police offices in Central and Northern Italy the Court was 
provided with contradictory information by the Italian authorities on the costs of the 
overall investment and on how the eligible costs were calculated. As a result it was 
unable to determine the extent to which the 22 million euro declared as eligible costs 
(to be co-financed 50 % by the EBF) in the 2007 annual programme was related to the 
EBF. 
Similar problems were found in Malta for a 2007 annual programme project totalling 
approximately 540 000 euro where the Member State was not able to demonstrate 
why certain costs (mainly relating to building works) were apportioned to the project.

Strategic and operational weaknesses in EBF programming and 
implementation at Member State and Commission level 
48.	The Court assessed key processes for the Fund’s effectiveness, namely 
programming and project selection, and found that programmes are not 
embedded in national strategies and lack SMART objectives and measurable 
indicators. Programming requirements lead to an excessive administrative 
burden. In certain Member States, project selection procedures did not 
adequately ensure that the Member States’ needs were met. In addition, the 
audit found weaknesses in procurement procedures, putting financial 
management at risk. 
Programmes not embedded in national strategies for border control and 
visas …
49.	In the selected Member States, the Court examined whether the multi-
annual programme and the annual programmes were based on a national 
strategy for border management and visa matters and if they were coordinated 
with national, other EU and international funds. According to the 3rd version of 
the Schengen Catalogue on external borders control, return and readmission  
such a strategy “should clearly delegate tasks” and include “the assessments of 
the working environment, risks and threats, analyses of resources needed, as 
well as action and development plans”. Only when such a comprehensive 
assessment exists can maximum efficiency and effectiveness be obtained from 
the EBF. The Court also analysed, on the basis of the Schengen Evaluations, 
whether such a national strategy was based on the Common Integrated Risk 
Analysis Model (CIRAM)  assessing relative risks posed by different threats 
for border and visa management. 
50.	In four out of the five Member States in the Court’s sample (that is, except 
Poland) the Court found that the multi-annual programme and, as a result the 
annual programmes, are not embedded in a comprehensive strategy, simply 
because no such strategy exists. While there were many individual strategy 
papers, these often remained confined to a single authority. Although the multi-
annual programmes were obliged to contain a section on complementarity 
between national and EBF funding, the Court found that explanations were 
incomplete or non-existent. In all five Member States a common integrated risk 
analysis is only in the development stage or is not used at all. This lack of a 
comprehensive view based on a risk analysis means that neither the 
Commission nor Member States can objectively determine whether the 
measures financed by the EBF fit into the general strategy of the Member 
States, target actual needs and why they were selected to be financed by the 
EBF.
51.	In three Member States (Spain, Malta and Poland) the Court found 
evidence that the EBF was not appropriately coordinated with other EU funds  
or with other international funds . This risks a loss in efficiency and 
effectiveness for the funds involved since they could each be targeting similar 
actions.
... lacking SMART objectives and measurable indicators
52.	The Court examined whether multi-annual and annual programmes and 
projects included SMART objectives and indicators which are relevant, 
measurable and paired with a target value. 
53.	The five Member States in the Court’s sample did not include SMART 
objectives and measurable indicators in their multi-annual and annual 
programmes or projects. Most programme and project descriptions lacked 
target values. In addition, in Greece targets for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 
annual programmes were only set after the projects had been implemented, 
thereby making them redundant. An analysis of 2012 annual programmes 
showed improvements in the formulation of indicators for three Member States, 
but for two of these no progress was made on establishing targets for 
indicators.
54.	Although it can be difficult to establish outcome and impact indicators for 
border management and visas, the Commission has shown in guidance notes 
that it is possible. Due to the absence of obligatory common indicators, 
Member States used differing sets of indicators, not only between programmes 
but also for similar measures, making proper evaluation impossible. Despite the 
low quality of the objectives and indicators in the Member States’ programmes, 
the Commission nevertheless approved them, in view of the need to implement 
the Fund (see Box 7).
Box 7 - Examples of vague and inappropriate indicators
One project consisted of the procurement of two medium-sized vessels for sea patrols 
and was funded by the Spanish 2008 annual programme. Similar to other audited 
projects in Spain , the Court found indicators which were not relevant, not recorded 
and/or set without appropriate consultation with the final beneficiary by the 
Responsible Authority. 
The ‘expected results’ of the project were very vague and mostly without explanation 
as to how they could be measured e.g. ‘enhanced efficacy and efficiency of the 
resources dedicated to sea patrol missions’, ‘better security conditions on missions’, 
and ‘greater border security’. The only measurable expected result was a ‘reduction in 
the number of vessels illegally reaching Spanish-European coasts’. However, the 
difficulty with this indicator is that the causal link between action and results needs to 
be carefully examined. 
55.	The Commission has already reacted to some of the weaknesses caused 
by the lack of common indicators by proposing obligatory common indicators 
for the funding period 2014-2020. Member States will have to develop 
programme-specific indicators.
Annual programming requirements leading to an excessive 
administrative burden and implementation difficulties
56.	While the intention was tighter supervision of the programmes put in place 
by the Responsible Authorities, the requirement to produce annual 
programmes in addition to multi-annual programmes led to an excessive 
administrative burden at both Member State and Commission level as well as 
significant delays. The initial submission of poor quality programmes by the 
Member States - frequently not respecting the requirements set out in the legal 
bases – caused delays in approval of annual programmes. The time lag 
between the first submission and the final version of annual programmes 
averaged six and a half months. As a result, the implementation time for 
projects was often severely reduced.
57.	The EBF’s annual programmes also did not fit well with the lengthy 
procurement procedures needed for sophisticated equipment. As a result, 
projects were delayed or could not be financed by the Fund. In recognition of 
the above-mentioned difficulties, only multi-annual programmes will be 
established in the 2014-2020 funding period.
Some Member States’ project selection procedures did not ensure that 
their actual needs are met
58.	The Court examined the procedure used by Member States to select 
projects. Serious weaknesses in the project selection procedures were found in 
Italy and, for the early years only, in Malta, putting into question whether the 
most relevant projects were selected. 
59.	In Italy, allocation of funds between public entities and subsequent project 
selection had several flaws. Due to a complete lack of audit trail, the Court 
could not verify on what basis the allocation between final beneficiaries was 
decided for the 2007 and 2008 annual programmes. For later years, the 
reasons given by the Responsible Authority for the distribution of the allocation 
were either misleading or not subsequently applied to the distribution of the 
resources. As a result, the increasingly high allocation for the Ministry of Interior 
- Department of Public Security - Central Directorate for Immigration and 
Border Police – the body in which the Responsible Authority is housed – to the 
detriment of other bodies such as the Coast Guard could not be justified. The 
same Ministry was also the only Italian body to have benefited from Emergency 
and Specific Actions between 2007-2012, even though several other forces 
(under different ministries) are involved in Italy’s border management. The 
exclusion or marginalisation of the other authorities risks that their needs are 
not met. 
60.	The selection and subsequent funding of a temporary detention centre in 
Greece did not comply with the principle of respectful treatment and dignity 
(see Box 8).
Box 8 - Funding for a detention centre in Greece
The Court examined the rental costs of a temporary detention centre at Pagani (also 
known as the Mytilini Special Facility for Irregular Migrants) on the island of Lesbos. 
The project was implemented by the Responsible Authority (Ministry of Public Order 
and Citizen Protection). 
The Responsible Authority included the project in a late revision to the 2008 annual 
programme, for “hosting of migrants in hotels and rooms”. However, what was actually 
financed was the rent of the Pagani centre from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2010 at a 
total cost of 267 405 euro. 
The centre was repeatedly criticised by human rights organisations for its poor 
conditions. Originally a storage site for goods, it was converted to accommodate 
300 persons. In 2008, there were 720 migrants detained in the facility. Conditions were 
described as “abominable” and “a health hazard for staff and detainees alike”  . In 
October 2009, upon visiting the centre, UNHCR called for the centre to be shut down. 
Between late October 2009 and June 2010 the centre was gradually deactivated.
At the time of the decision to fund the project, the unacceptable conditions were widely 
known. The Greek authorities, however, provided a misleading project description to 
the Commission which, upon analysis of the final report, now plans to deduct the 
expenditure from the final payment. 
Inadequate procurement procedures in Member States putting sound 
financial management at risk
61.	The Court audited the procurement procedures in eleven projects. In eight 
of these the procedures did not satisfy the relevant legal provisions or were 
conducted in a way which did not ensure that value for money was achieved. 
One procurement procedure, the acquisition of patrol dogs in Greece, failed 
completely due to an inadequate procedure. Although the 40 vehicles were 
delivered in May 2012, the dogs had not been procured as at June 2014. 
62.	The main weakness was the fact that three Member States did not 
adequately justify their use of the exception clause for defence and security 
procurements. For example, under its 2007 annual programme, Spain procured 
two fixed-wing aircraft for maritime patrols and the fight against irregular 
immigration at a cost of 50 million euro. The Spanish authorities declared the 
procurement to be “secret” and used the negotiated procedure without prior 
publication, inviting only one supplier. Less restrictive procedures could have 
been used without compromising security. In other Member States similar 
procurements were made using open tendering. 
63.	Other weaknesses in procurement procedures were the subsequent use of 
the same supplier without adequate competition and a lack of capacity and 
knowledge in public administration. 
64.	The Responsible Authorities’ verification of procurement procedures in four 
out of the five Member States (all except Poland) was inadequate or non-
existent despite large parts of EBF being spent using procurement.
65.	As a result, there is a risk that high value actions in certain programmes of 
the EBF such as the procurement of aircraft and vessels may not provide value 
for money.
Weaknesses in Responsible Authorities’ monitoring and serious 
deficiencies in the ex post evaluations by the Commission and Member 
States do not allow an adequate assessment of the Fund’s overall 
achievements 
66.	The Court sought to determine whether Member States and the 
Commission use monitoring and evaluation to assess and improve the 
effectiveness of the EBF. It found that monitoring and evaluation were seriously 
constrained by the lack of SMART objectives and measurable indicators, that 
there is a lack of adequate monitoring and reporting of projects at Member 
State level and that evaluation is delayed and suffers from serious deficiencies. 
Lack of adequate monitoring and reporting of projects by Member States
67.	In all of the Member States in the Court’s sample, the Responsible Authority 
did not carry out sufficient and/or adequate monitoring which would have 
enabled it to follow the implementation of projects and determine deviations 
from set objectives. Where they existed, monitoring reports lacked important 
information such as results achieved against indicators or targets set or 
significant changes in the project execution stage. In Greece, there was no 
monitoring during project implementation for 2007-2009 because projects were 
generally introduced into the annual programme after they had been carried 
out. Although some on-the-spot checks were carried out, no checklists were 
available to show that qualitative aspects of funded projects were verified.
68.	In all five Member States, both at project level and for annual programmes, 
the final reports did not report satisfactorily on indicators or targets achieved. In 
three Member States there were several inconsistencies and errors in the final 
reports impacting on the reliability of the data. Spain did not require final project 
reports until the 2010 annual programme and only started monitoring during 
implementation from the 2009 annual programme. At the time of the audit 
(February 2014), Greece still did not require final project reports, which 
seriously restricts the information available on the project results achieved. 
Italy’s Responsible Authority has announced its intention to introduce 
monitoring visits as a result of the Court’s audit. 
69.	None of the Member States in the Court’s sample had set up an appropriate 
IT system from the start of the Fund to record indicators. While three Member 
States (Spain, Italy and Malta) have started developing an IT system that 
supports the RA management in the second half of the funding period, only the 
Italian system has a function that allows indicators and their values to be 
recorded. The Commission’s guidance did not explain the benefits of such IT 
systems and opportunities for exchange of best practices were lost.
70.	The reporting by Member States on Community Actions and Specific 
Actions show a similar lack of information on results achieved, often failing to 
include even the most basic information.

Delays and serious deficiencies in the ex post evaluations at both 
Member State and Commission level
71.	The Commission, in partnership with the Member States, is responsible for 
evaluating the Fund in order to assess the relevance, effectiveness and impact 
of its actions. The first of the two ex post evaluations, covering 2007-2010, was 
due to be delivered by the Commission to the European Parliament and other 
institutions by 31 December 2012.
72.	The Court analysed the contributions of the Member States in the Court’s 
sample to this evaluation and found a series of omissions, errors and 
inaccuracies in all five national evaluation reports. As a result, the reliability of 
the overall ex post evaluation report is significantly reduced. Part of the reason 
for the limited amount of quantified information provided by the Member States 
was that the type of data to be reported was only established by the 
Commission in 2011. By this point all actions for inclusion in the evaluation had 
started and most had finished, and consequently Member States’ were unable 
to adapt indicators to be collected. This led to a general weakness in the quality 
of quantitative information presented in the evaluation, as well as inefficiency 
and additional work in compiling data retroactively.
73.	In analysing the Commission’s ex post evaluation report, the Court found 
summaries of a large amount of both qualitative and quantitative information 
which had been collected from the Member States. However, the presentation 
of the data is descriptive in nature, without analysis of their significance. For 
example, data are presented without any useful baseline or benchmark 
information or in a format which does not offer additional understanding (e.g. 
“number of systems acquired or upgraded”). Furthermore, the evaluation omits 
to deal with Community Actions, Emergency Actions and Specific Actions 
thereby further diminishing its value. Consequently, the ex post evaluation 
cannot be considered a useful or reliable report to assess the effective impact 
of the External Borders Fund.
74.	Despite an extended deadline, only eight out of the 28 Member States sent 
their contribution to the Commission on time, thereby encroaching upon the 
time available for the Commission and its external contractor to work with the 
data. Delays also occurred at Commission level. At the time of the conclusion 
of the Court’s audit work (March 2014) and more than one year after the 
deadline, the report had not yet been adopted by the Commission, limiting the 
availability of information for EBF stakeholders.



CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
75.	The audit showed that the EBF has contributed to external border 
management and fostered financial solidarity. However its further EU added 
value was limited, overall result could not be measured due to weaknesses in 
the Responsible Authorities’ monitoring and there were serious deficiencies in 
the  ex post evaluations by the Commission and the Member States. Crucially, 
the audit found serious weaknesses in the management of the Fund in key 
Member States, i.e. in Greece, Spain, Italy and, for the early funding years, 
Malta. These weaknesses carry the risk that border management is not 
adequately strengthened where it is most needed.
The EBF has contributed to external border management, but the overall 
result could not be measured due to the lack of SMART objectives and 
serious deficiencies in evaluation
76.	The Court found that it was not able to assess the extent to which the EBF 
has supported the Fund’s priorities. Member States’ programmes lacked 
SMART objectives and measurable indicators which, together with the lack of 
common indicators, made proper evaluation by the Commission impossible. 
Despite the low quality of the objectives and indicators, the Commission 
approved the Member States’ programmes, in view of the need to implement 
the Fund (see paragraphs 53 to 54).
77.	Responsible Authorities did not or only insufficiently monitored the 
achievement of results. Monitoring and final reports lacked relevant information 
on effectiveness and/or information was unreliable. None of the Member States 
in the Court’s sample had an IT system to collect monitoring data from the start. 
Only Italy was developing such a system for future use (see paragraph 72). 
The Member States’ contributions to the ex post evaluation and the 
Commission’s report suffered delays and had serious deficiencies (see 
paragraph 73).
78.	The Commission has proposed obligatory common indicators for the 2014-
2020 funding period and Member States will have to develop their own 
programme-specific indicators.

Recommendation 1
The Commission should:
-	ensure that all indicators to be used are relevant, measurable and, where 
possible, paired with a target value;
-	ensure that indicators are collected from the start and, where not already in 
place, that IT systems are developed;
-	provide clear guidelines to Member States so that they have a common 
understanding of obligatory indicators so that aggregation for monitoring 
and evaluation purposes will be possible;
-	deliver its evaluation report on time and present stakeholders with an 
analysis of underlying data.

Recommendation 2
Member States should: 
-	have appropriate expertise  available in the administration for the design 
and application of SMART objectives and measurable indicators;
-	set targets for output, outcome and, where possible, impact indicators;
-	collect actual values of indicators from the start of the programme using 
appropriate IT systems and ensure that information is reliable;
-	apply their experience with similar IT systems gained in the Structural 
Funds field.

The EBF has fostered financial solidarity but further EU added value has 
been limited
79.	The Court found that the EBF helped to spread the Member States’ financial 
burden arising from the integrated management of external borders but that 
further EU added value of the Fund was limited:
(a)	in consular cooperation; 
(b)	in support of Frontex operations;
(c)	on Emergency Actions and Specific Actions;
(d)	by funding actions which were or would have been financed nationally. 
The Fund’s full potential was not exploited due to weaknesses in the design of 
the incentive system.
80.	For the period 2014-2020, the Commission has proposed to incentivise 
consular cooperation and the Fund’s contribution to Frontex operations. While 
enhanced involvement of Frontex is planned in the Fund’s management, 
comprehensive information exchange between the Agency and the 
Commission in both shared and direct management programme 
implementation is not envisaged. In addition, there is still no general obligation 
that EBF/ISF funded assets which would be of use to Frontex should be 
entered into the Frontex technical equipment pool. 
Recommendation 3
To support consular cooperation:
-	the Member States and Commission should concentrate more on 
establishing Common Application Centres and other forms of consular 
cooperation rather than the renovation, adaptation or equipping of 
consulates.

Recommendation 4
To support the work of Frontex:
-	the legislator should consider making the entering of relevant ISF co-
financed assets into Frontex’s technical equipment pool obligatory;
-	the Commission should provide Frontex with relevant, comprehensive and 
timely information regarding EBF/ISF implementation in the Member States 
such as programmes, annual implementation reports and evaluations as 
well as information on directly managed programmes and projects. 
Information should take into account the option of “operating support” 
introduced with the new 2014-2020 framework and a robust system to 
avoid double funding needs to be put in place.
Strategic weaknesses in EBF programming
81.	The audit found that four out of five Member States do not programme the 
EBF as part of their comprehensive national strategy on border and visa 
management. In all Member States in the Court’s sample a common integrated 
risk analysis is only under development or is not used at all. 
Recommendation 5
The national EBF programmes should be based on a comprehensive strategy 
for border management, with Member States basing their strategy on a risk 
analysis using the Common Integrated Risk Analysis Model. 

Recommendation 6
The legislator should consider making compliance with Schengen Catalogue 
recommendations on strategy and risk analysis an ex-ante condition for 
receiving future ISF support.
Weaknesses in EBF implementation 
82.	In the three principal recipient Member States (Greece, Spain and Italy) the 
Court found recurrent deficiencies in EBF planning, implementation, monitoring 
and evaluation, impacting on the effectiveness of the EBF. 
83.	In the Member States in the Court’s sample (apart from Poland) the Court 
found inadequate procurement procedures which put the sound financial 
management of the Fund at risk.
Recommendation 7
Administrative capacity needs to be strengthened, for example through focused 
training by the Commission or through sharing best practices between Member 
States. 

Recommendation 8
Member States should strengthen administrative capacity in procurement and 
carry out the procurement of EBF/ISF assets through the most transparent 
procedures available.

The aim of the project was to create the first real Schengen Common Visa Application 
Centre. While each participating Member State would be responsible for the back office 
treatment, the application processes are centralised allowing multiple Member States to 
pool and share resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Belgium’s 
partner in the project was Portugal (Ministerio Dos Negocios Estrangeiros).

Additionality
The EU SME guarantee facility is intended to provide 
additional access to finance for SMEs and not to 
substitute for state spending. Additionality will 
typically occur if lending volumes increase when 
compared to a scenario without EU intervention.
CIP
The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework 
Programme was established by Council Decision No 
1639/2006 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council covering the period 2007-2013. It is a 
programme launched by DG ENTR and DG ECFIN, 
managed by the EIF under the supervision of DG 
ECFIN to foster entrepreneurship and innovation of 
EU SMEs.

EIF
The European Investment Fund has been set up by 
the EIB to structure and grant specialised financial 
products, including venture capital, guarantee 
instruments for SMEs and securitisation. The EIF 
works with a network of financial intermediaries, many 
of which are specialised in SME finance. In the 
context of the CIP, the EIF can be seen as the 
operational manager of the SME Guarantee facility.
EIP
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is 
one of 3 pillars of the CIP framework to promote 
entrepreneurship and innovation.

Financial instruments
In the text this refers to the SMEG facility. Other 
Community financial instruments for SMEs under the 
EIP Programme include the High Growth and 
Innovative SME Facility (GIF) and the Capacity 
Building Scheme (CBS).
Financial intermediary
The financial intermediaries participating in the SMEG 
facility can be public guarantee institutions, mutual 
guarantee organisations, micro-finance institutions or 
commercial banks. They may be direct lenders that 
provide loans to SMEs, or indirect guarantee 
organisations that either co-guarantee or counter-
guarantee a loan portfolio, of one or several direct 
lenders.

G&E
The Growth and Employment initiative established by 
Council Decision 347/1998 covering the period 1998-
2000. The successor programme of G&E is the MAP.
Guarantee cap amount
The guarantee cap amount refers to the maximum 
amount of losses for which the EIF is liable under an 
EU guarantee.
Guarantee cap rate
The guarantee cap rate is a pre-agreed rate at which 
the EIFâ€™s liability is capped under a guarantee 
agreement. The amount of the EIFâ€™s liability under a 
guarantee agreement (guarantee cap amount) can be 
calculated by multiplying the actual portfolio volume 
by the guarantee rate and the guarantee cap rate. 
E.g. portfolio volume = 1000; guarantee rate = 50 %; 
guarantee cap rate = 10 %. Thus, maximum EIF 
liability (guarantee cap amount) = 1000 x 50 % x 
10 % = 50.
Guarantee deal
Guarantee deals are the individual guarantee 
agreements between the EIF and a financial 
intermediary covering the activities performed on the 
basis of these agreements.
Impact
Longer-term socio-economic consequences that can 
be observed after the completion of an intervention, 
which may affect either direct or indirect addressees 
of the intervention. 
Implementation report
The CIP Council Decision stipulates that the 
Commission should draw up an annual 
implementation report for the Framework Programme 
and for each specific programme, examining the 
supported activities in terms of financial 
implementation, results and, where possible, impact. 
The Commission should communicate the annual 
implementation reports to the European Parliament, 
the Council, the European Economic and Social 
Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
Input


Financial, human and material resources that are 
mobilised for the implementation of an intervention. 
Lisbon Strategy
During the meeting of the European Council in Lisbon 
(March 2000), the Heads of State or Government 
launched a "Lisbon Strategy" aimed at making the 
European Union the most competitive economy in the 
world and achieving full employment by 2010.
MAP
The Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise and 
Entrepreneurship covering the period 2001-2006 is an 
SME programme of DG ENTR managed by the EIF 
under the supervision of DG ECFIN. It was the 
predecessor programme of the CIP.
Maximum portfolio 
amount 
The maximum portfolio amount is the maximum loan 
volume which may be covered by the EU guarantee. 
It is established by the EIF for each financial 
intermediary, taking into account various 
considerations such as the available EU budget and 
comparable past lending volumes. 
OECD

Development
Outcome
Change that arises from the implementation of an 
intervention and which normally relates to the 
objectives of this intervention. Outcomes include 
results and impacts. Outcomes may be expected or 
unexpected, positive or negative. 
Output
What is produced or accomplished with the resources 
allocated to an intervention. 
Reference volume
Reference volume represents the amount of 
guarantees or financing which the intermediary could 
reasonably be expected to achieve in the absence of 
the EU guarantee.
Result
Immediate changes that arise for direct addressees at 
the end of their participation in an intervention. 
SME
Small and Medium-sized Enterprise. As per 
Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 
concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-
sized enterprises, SMEs are defined as enterprises 
which employ fewer than 250 employees, which have 
an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, 
and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 
43 million euro and conform to the criterion of being 
an autonomous enterprise.
SMEG facility




SME Guarantee facility: a financial instrument 
managed by the EIF, providing guarantees or counter 
guarantees to financial intermediaries for loans 
granted by financial institutions to SMEs aiming at 
increasing the SMEsâ€™ debt financing supply.
SMEG windows
The four windows of the SMEG facility are:
*	debt financing via loans or leasing,
*	microcredit financing,
*	guarantees for equity or quasi-equity 
investments in SMEs, and
*	securitisation of SME debt finance portfolios.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I. The SME Guarantee (SMEG) facility is a financial instrument managed by 
the 
European Investment Fund on behalf of the European Commission and 
providing 
guarantees or counter guarantees to financial intermediaries for loans 
granted by 
financial institutions to SMEs aimed at increasing the supply of debt 
financing.

II. The objective of the Courtâ€™s audit was to assess the effectiveness of 
the SMEG 
facility, notably the design and planning, the management of its 
operations and 
the achievement of its objectives. 

III. The Court found that the objectives of the current SMEG facility are 
more 
precise than under the predecessor programmes, but they are only 
specific, 
measurable, achievable and timed in relation to the expected outputs. The 
intervention logic was not made explicit and limited quantification of 
potential 
impacts was provided at the planning stage of the facility. 

IV. The framework for the management of daily operations is considered 
appropriate, but does not include scoring standards or minimum 
requirements for 
the selection of financial intermediaries. 

V. Sufficient output indicators were established, which were used to 
report on 
SMEGâ€™s implementation. Reporting requirements are satisfactory and 
accepted 
by the financial intermediaries. 

VI. The only quantified target relating to the number of SMEs to be 
reached with 
the SMEG facility is attainable. Concerning the purpose of the loans 
granted, less 
than half were given to SMEs that lacked collateral and only 12 % were 
given to 
SMEs that used them for innovative investments. The analysis of the 
Courtâ€™s 
sample of loans identified a deadweight of 38 %. The EU added value of 
the 
facility was not clearly demonstrated before it was launched neither is 
it indicated 
in the guarantee agreements with the financial intermediaries. 

VII. The Court recommends that the programme logic should be made 
explicit in 
any similar future intervention, and additional or better performance 
indicators 
considered. The selection of potential financial intermediaries should be 
based on 
minimum requirements for the criteria that have to be fulfilled by the 
applicants 
and a scoring system should be put in place to make the applications 
comparable. 
Appropriate measures to minimise deadweight should be envisaged. During 
the 
planning period, the EU added value of the instrument should be clearly 
demonstrated. 


INTRODUCTION
SMEs and access to finance
1.	Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU 
economy , representing 99 % of all enterprises and providing 75 million 
jobs in the 
European Union .  However, the financial markets are wary of investing in 
new or 
young SMEs which are perceived as high-risk investments, especially if 
they are 
in innovative markets. According to the Observatory of European SMEs , 
limited 
access to finance is a problem for SMEs in Europe. The public sector has 
an 
important role to play in supporting the SME sector, in particular the 
provision of 
suitable financing. 
2.	SME policy is a key element of the Lisbon Strategy aiming to make 
Europe a 
more attractive place to invest and work . The Lisbon Strategy stressed 
that 
entrepreneurial initiatives and innovation must be stimulated and 
encouraged. 
Therefore a friendly environment should be created for starting up 
innovative 
businesses, especially SMEs . One of the EU support measures to SMEs 
facilitates their access to external finance and is known as the SME 
Guarantee 
(SMEG) facility. 
3.	The SMEG facility was established in October 2006 as part of the 
Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)  . It originates 
in 
Council Decision 98/347/EC on measures of financial assistance for 
innovative 
and job-creating SMEs â€“ Growth and Employment (G&E), which was continued 
as part of the subsequent Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise and 
Entrepreneurship (MAP)  established in 2001. Under the CIP, the SMEG 
facility is 
one of the Communityâ€™s financial instruments which were launched under 
the 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP) (see Annex I). 
4.	The EIP has wide ranging objectives: â€œto improve access to finance 
for the 
start-up and growth of SMEs and investment in innovation activitiesâ€. The 
SMEG 
facility encompasses different types of guarantee schemes, each aiming to 
support entrepreneurship through the enhancement of SME access to 
finance. It 
comprises four different schemes (or â€˜windowsâ€™), the loans and leases 
window, 
the micro credit window, the equity and quasi-equity window and the 
securitisation 
window.
5.	The SMEG facility was allocated 978 million euro for the period 1998 
to 2013 
under the three successive framework programmes (G&E, MAP and CIP). At 
the 
end of 2009 this budget guaranteed a total loan portfolio of 10,6 billion 
euro (see 
Table 1).

6.	510 million euro are earmarked under the current CIP for the period 
2007 to 
2013. The budget is only drawn upon when guaranteed loans default, and 
for 
each intermediary a maximum EU budget liability is fixed. Until 31 
December 
2009 the total amount of guarantee calls made under the CIP was 1,7 
million 
euro. For a detailed breakdown of the results achieved by the facility 
under the 
CIP, see Table 2.

The main features of the SMEG facility
7.	The operational management of the SMEG facility involves several 
parties 
(see Figure 1).
Figure 1 - Overview of the SMEG process flow
 
Source: European Court of Auditors.
8.	Two Directorates General at the European Commission, plus the 
European 
Investment Fund (EIF) , are all involved in the design, management and 
monitoring of the SMEG facility. The Directorate General for Enterprise 
and 
Industry (DG ENTR) is the coordinator of the legal basis, prepares the 
annual 
work programmes and implementation reports of the various CIP pillars and 
is 
responsible for organising the programme evaluations. The Directorate 
General 
for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) has the direct management 
responsibilities for SMEG, being in charge of negotiating the Fiduciary 
and 
Management Agreement (FMA) with the EIF , approving financial 
intermediaries, 
monitoring cash movements on the trust accounts and ensuring that funds 
are 
spent in line with the CIPâ€™s objectives.  
9.	The EIF provides guarantees to financial intermediaries aiming to 
improve 
their lending capacity and, therefore, the availability and terms of 
loans towards 
SMEs. The EIF signs guarantee agreements in its own name, on behalf of 
the 
Commission and at the risk and cost of the Union budget. In order to 
allow the 
Commission to monitor the facility, the EIF reports to DG ECFIN on the 
progress 
achieved on a quarterly basis.
10.	The financial intermediaries participating in the SMEG facility are 
public 
guarantee institutions, mutual guarantee organisations, micro-finance 
institutions 
and commercial or publicly owned or controlled banks. They can be direct 
lenders 
that provide loans to SMEs or indirect guarantee organisations that 
either co-
guarantee or counter-guarantee  a SME loan portfolio of one or several 
direct 
lenders. Each guarantee deal  determines specific target volumes for the 
loans to 
be achieved by the financial intermediary. 
11.	SMEs have to meet the Commissionâ€™s SME definition to be eligible for 
a 
guarantee under the SMEG facility. An SME is defined as an enterprise 
which 
employs fewer than 250 employees and which has an annual turnover not 
exceeding 50 million euro and/or an annual balance sheet total not 
exceeding 
43 million euro. It must also satisfy the criterion of being an 
autonomous 
enterprise .
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
12.	The objective of the Courtâ€™s audit was to assess the effectiveness of 
the 
SMEG facility by addressing the following audit questions:
-	Has the Commission designed the SMEG facility and its management 
structure in a coherent and effective manner?
-	Have the Commission and the EIF established and applied effective 
procedures to select appropriate financial intermediaries and to monitor 
the 
performance of the SMEG facility?
-	Have the SME guarantee deals contributed to the achievement of the 
policyâ€™s objectives? 
13.	The audit examined the roles and responsibilities of all main parties 
involved in 
the SMEG facility â€“ the Commission, the EIF and the financial 
intermediaries. The 
main focus was the SMEG facility under the CIP (2007-2013); the SMEG 
under 
the MAP was used for the purpose of comparisons with the CIP. 
14.	The audit covered the following:
-	an assessment of whether the SMEG objectives were SMART and whether 
the design and planning of the facility was likely to achieve effective 
results;
-	an evaluation of the management of the SMEG facilityâ€™s operations, 
comprising an assessment of the financial intermediary selection 
procedures and the Commission and EIF reporting and monitoring 
procedures;
-	visits to nine financial intermediaries  (out of the 14 that were 
contracted at 
the audit planning stage in June 2009). They were selected according to 
the following criteria: (i) type of guarantee, (ii) actual guarantee 
volume 
achieved, (iii) type of financial intermediary, and iv) direct guarantee 
or 
counter-guarantee. For each financial intermediary the related guarantee 
proposal, its assessment by the EIF and the Commission and the 
agreement signed between the EIF and the financial intermediary were 
examined;
-	selection of a sample of 181 loans from the nine financial 
intermediaries 
visited in order to assess that the use of the guaranteed SME loans was 
in 
line with the SMEG objectives ; and
-	a questionnaire to all 51 financial intermediaries participating 
under MAP 
and/or CIP  in order to obtain their views on the design and management 
of the SMEG facility . 
AUDIT FINDINGS
Design of the SMEG facility
15.	Public intervention is more likely to be successful if it is properly 
designed. In 
order to assess the design, this section analyses the intervention logic 
underlying 
the SMEG facility. It scrutinises the ex-ante impact assessment for the 
CIP  
related to the SMEG facility and the extent to which the results of this 
assessment 
were taken into account during the design stage. Finally, the objectives 
of the 
SMEG facility are assessed in the light of specific, measurable, 
achievable, 
relevant and timed (SMART) criteria.
The SMEG facility is based on a valid implicit intervention logic
16.	The intervention logic provides the link between an intervention's 
inputs and 
the production of its outputs and, subsequently, to its impacts on 
society in terms 
of results and outcomes. It describes how an intervention is expected to 
attain its 
global objectives. An explicit intervention logic shows how the programme 
is 
supposed to function.
17.	Neither the CIP Decision nor the Commissionâ€™s proposal or the impact 
assessment for CIP explicitly described the intervention logic of the 
SMEG facility 
in this manner. The absence of an explicit intervention logic was also 
noted by the 
EIP interim evaluator . 
18.	The different preparatory documents, however, do provide sufficient 
information to make an implicit assumption on how the SMEG facility is 
supposed 
to function. For lenders it can be difficult to assess individual loan 
applications and 
the risks involved, especially if a borrower does not have an established 
track 
record (start-ups). In such a situation the borrowers can guarantee the 
loan to the 
lender through the provision of collateral, but those who do not have 
sufficient 
collateral may be denied access to credit even with viable business 
propositions. 
The SMEG facility seeks to remedy this situation by providing guarantees 
in cases 
where the SMEs are unable to do so. 
19.	Nevertheless, in the absence of an explicit intervention logic, it is 
difficult to 
understand the rationale of some specific elements of the SMEG facility, 
such as 
targeting innovative SMEs by the loan window. Innovative SMEs are 
targeted 
through debt financing although equity investments are generally 
considered more 
appropriate for this type of SME .
The impact assessment helped to design the facility; however, it 
contained 
little factual evidence in support of the facility
20.	The impact assessment is an important instrument used by the 
Commission 
when designing a policy . The impact assessment should identify and 
analyse 
the problem at stake,  the objectives to be pursued and the main policy 
options 
that are available to achieve those objectives. For the various policy 
options, the 
assessment should evaluate their likely economic, social and 
environmental 
impacts. Finally, the impact assessment should identify the monitoring 
and 
evaluation arrangements needed during policy implementation.
21.	As regards the SMEG facility, this type of analysis forms part of the 
CIP impact 
assessment. The CIP impact assessment contained all the mandatory 
sections 
and as such it gives insight into the considerations that shaped the 
design of the 
CIP and its main elements such as the SMEG facility. Thus, the CIP impact 
assessment represents an improvement compared to the MAP, for which no 
such 
analysis was made. 
22.	However, many parts of the CIP impact assessment are not sufficiently 
detailed and quantified. For example, the analysis of the problem lacks 
any 
indication of its magnitude and the analysis of different policy options 
is based 
only on a simplistic qualitative comparison without any quantification of 
the likely 
impacts. For the retained option, except for the impact on the number of 
jobs, the 
Commission quantified expected outputs  instead of the impact. 
Compared to MAP, the objectives are more precise, but still lack clarity 
and 
specific targets 
23.	SMART objectives shall be set for any budget activity . The 
objectives are 
considered:
-	specific if they are precise and concrete enough not to be open to 
varying 
interpretations ; 
-	measurable if the output can be measured and therefore any 
improvements 
assessed; 
-	achievable if the expected results can realistically be produced with 
the 
available resources;
-	relevant if they relate to the needs and to the strategic objectives; 
and
-	timed if they relate to a deadline or time period24.
24.	Due to the rather complex structure of the CIP (see Annex I), the 
hierarchical 
structure of the objectives is also complex. Four global objectives are 
set at the 
level of the framework programme . In the case of the EIP which includes 
the 
SMEG facility, the immediate objectives  are defined at the level of the 
specific 
programme . Although no specific objectives are set at the level of the 
financial 
instruments, article 19.2 of the CIP Decision describes each window of 
the SMEG 
facility in an objective-like fashion (see Box 1).
Box 1-  Objectives relevant to the SMEG facility
Global objective
To foster the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular of SMEs.
Immediate objective 
To improve (â€¦) access to finance for the start-up and growth of SMEs and 
investment in innovation activities.
The four SMEG windows 
Loan window - shall reduce the particular difficulties SMEs face in 
accessing 
finance either due to the perceived higher risk associated with 
investments in 
certain knowledge-related activities such as technological development, 
innovation and technology transfer, or due to a lack of sufficient 
collateral.
Microcredit window - shall encourage financial institutions to play a 
greater role in 
the provision of loans of a smaller amount which would normally involve 
proportionately higher unit handling costs for borrowers with 
insufficient collateral. 
In addition to guarantees or counter-guarantees, financial intermediaries 
may 
receive grants to partially offset the high administrative costs inherent 
in micro 
credit financing.
Equity and quasi equity window - shall include investments which provide 
seed 
capital and/or capital in the start-up phase, as well as mezzanine 
financing, in 
order to reduce the particular difficulties which SMEs face because of 
their weak 
financial structure, and those arising from business transfers.
Securitisation window - shall mobilise additional debt financing for SMEs 
under 
appropriate risk-sharing arrangements with the targeted institutions. 
Support for 
those transactions shall be made available upon an undertaking by the 
originating 
institutions to grant a significant part of the liquidity resulting from 
the mobilised 
capital for new SME lending in a reasonable period of time.
25.	The objectives are relevant, but they are only specific, stated in a 
measurable 
format and timed as regards the expected outputs of the facility. The 
quantified 
target of reaching 315 750 SMEs seems to be reasonably achievable (see 
paragraph 77). 
26.	Compared to the MAP, the objectives of the SMEG facility were more 
precise. 
However, they are defined in a very broad manner. For instance, according 
to the 
EIP immediate objective, the loans have â€œto improve access to finance for 
the 
start-up and growth of SMEsâ€. Such an objective implies a very broad set 
of 
potential target SMEs as it can be argued that almost any borrowing by 
any SME 
will be undertaken in order to ensure the growth of a company. Also, the 
concept 
of innovation has been interpreted in a wide way .
27.	The CIP impact assessment sets an output target for the number of 
SMEs 
expected to benefit within the seven year programme horizon. Targets in 
terms of 
results or impact have not been set (for more details, see paragraph 64). 
An 
estimated number of direct jobs maintained or created within five years 
was 
provided in the impact assessment. This does not directly relate to any 
of the 
objectives, but can be derived from the renewed Lisbon strategy.
Setting up the management structure of the SMEG facility: delegating the 
day-to-day management to the EIF 
28.	The cornerstone of efficient and effective delegation is the 
contractual 
agreement detailing the provisions for the implementation of the tasks 
entrusted to 
the specialised body. This contractual agreement should in particular 
detail the 
obligations of the specialised body and include all appropriate 
arrangements for 
ensuring that the policy objectives will be attained . 
29.	The EIF has systematically developed expertise in providing financial 
engineering products to SMEs in Europe. It was selected by the European 
Community to operate the day-to-day management of the SMEG facility at 
its start 
in 1998. Using the EIF under the successive multi-annual programmes (G&E, 
MAP and then CIP) aims to ensure the required continuity of the 
management of 
the SMEG facility. 
30.	In this context, the Court examined: 
-	whether the implementation of the SMEG facility was being effectively 
planned to avoid delays and to provide an uninterrupted support to the 
SMEs; 
and
-	whether the regulatory framework  defining the services to be 
provided by 
the EIF ensures efficient and effective management of the facility.
Delays in planning the SMEG facility
31.	Considering that the MAP covered the period from 2001 to 2006 and the 
CIP 
covers the period from 2007 to 2013, the start of the operations under 
the CIP 
should have been planned in order to preserve the continuity of the 
financial 
support. The FMA should have been in place at least 11 months (see 
paragraph 
33) before the start of the CIP as this would have left sufficient time 
for signing the 
guarantee agreements between the EIF and the financial intermediaries.
32.	The first draft version of the FMA under the CIP was dated March 
2006, but 
was not signed until 20 September 2007, nearly nine months after the 
start of the 
CIP. Thereafter, it took almost one year until the first guarantee 
agreement 
between the EIF and a financial intermediary was signed  (see Figure 2).
Figure 2 - Timeline of the MAP and CIP legal base
 
33.	The average period from the receipt of the CIP application from an 
intermediary up to the signature of the agreement was nearly eleven 
months . 
Moreover, the timeframe for the application process was considered to be 
unreasonable by eight out of 21 respondents to the Courtâ€™s questionnaire 
. This 
delay in the selection process was mainly caused by the need to resolve 
technical 
issues raised by the EIF before the implementation of the SMEG facility, 
such as 
agreeing on a definition of and measuring the additionality of the loan 
guarantees 
(see paragraph 84). Altogether, this led to a significant time gap in the 
transition of 
the successive programmes.
To preserve the continuity of the support a â€œretroactivity clauseâ€ was 
introduced
34.	The continuity of the support is important for the financial 
intermediaries as 
some introduced specific loan products tailored to the needs of the SMEG 
facility. 
The interruption of EU support could cause higher losses to the financial 
intermediaries if the product was maintained without the EU guarantee.  
35.	The â€œretroactivity clauseâ€ was introduced with the aim of minimising 
the time 
gap between the two successive programmes and preserving continuity 
between 
the MAP and CIP programmes. This clause enabled the financial 
intermediaries to 
retroactively include loans to be supported by the facility which they 
had entered 
into between the end of the availability period under MAP and the date on 
which 
their CIP guarantee agreement was signed. 
36.	As a result, the equal treatment of financial intermediaries was not 
ensured 
since the financial intermediaries which had participated in the MAP 
benefited 
from favourable treatment through the retroactive inclusion of loans. 
Loans could 
be retroactively included as from September 2007, whereas new financial 
intermediaries could only include loans once their guarantee agreement 
with the 
EIF  had been signed.
37.	Although the retroactivity clause was designed to resolve the 
financial 
intermediariesâ€™ funding gap between MAP and CIP, it could not always 
prevent a 
disruption of EU support to SMEs. This was the case for two of the nine 
financial 
intermediaries visited for which the availability period under MAP ended 
before 
the start of the CIP availability period (a gap of four months). 
Appropriate management framework established to operate the SMEG 
facility 
38.	The SMEG facility operates under the joint management of the 
Commission 
and the EIF . To ensure a successful delegation, the FMA and the related 
operational guidelines should include:
-	a definition of the action to be implemented, such as the specific 
objectives 
per window (see Box 1 for a description of the windows);
-	the management structure for the implementation of the tasks; and
-	the setting up of an adequate fee structure for the services provided 
by the 
EIF.
39.	Article 3 of the FMA stipulates the tasks the EIF has to implement 
(see Box 2): 
Box 2 â€“ EIF main tasks for managing the SMEG facility:
- Identification, evaluation and selection of financial intermediaries;
- Determination of, and agreement with, the financial intermediaries on 
the nature 
and detailed conditions of the EU guarantees; 
- Decisions to commit funds; and
- Execution, management and termination of the EU guarantees (including 
reporting and monitoring).
40.	For each SMEG window, operational guidelines  were developed 
detailing the 
specific purpose, the selection of the intermediaries, the eligibility 
criteria, the EU 
guarantee and the modus operandi. The Commission issued Guidance on 
Enhanced Access to Finance on 29 October 2007 to supplement these 
operational guidelines, in particular the provisions of the FMA on 
establishing the 
parameters of the guarantee agreement. 
41.	The management structure established for the SMEG facility was 
appropriate 
as it improved the operational guidelines and the other provisions for 
the 
implementation of the tasks compared with those under the MAP, since they 
cover all tasks to be carried out in sufficient detail.  
42.	The fees to be paid to the EIF should be calculated so as to take 
into account:
-	performance in achieving specific targets;
-	the geographical distribution in the eligible countries; and
-	the degree of novelty and complexity of the guarantee instrument.
43.	The EIF fee scheme has been improved under CIP compared to MAP since:
-	the fee structure has been split into four distinctive components 
better 
reflecting the associated workload for each task; and 
-	the fee entitlement is triggered by the achievement of specific 
results (see  
Table 3).
Table 3 - Overview of the four incentives fees that constitute EIF 
remuneration

To mainly encourage :
Start-up Fee

specific windows
Implementation Fee
Additional volume achieved and daily operations
Monitoring Fee
Assurance of sound financial management
Source: Annex 13 of the Fiduciary and Management Agreement.
44.	The EIF â€œsignature feeâ€ gives a specific bonus for wide geographic 
coverage of 
intermediaries. Furthermore, fees are paid for the participation of 
intermediaries in 
countries that were not covered before and also for new intermediaries 
who did 
not participate under the previous programmes. 
45.	Despite the incentive fee for using specific windows, the equity and 
quasi-
equity guarantees and securitisation windows had not been utilised as at 
31 
December 2009. This is partly due to the financial crisis which 
negatively 
impacted the securitisation market as a whole.
Selection of financial intermediaries
46.	The audit assessed the selection process in respect of the following:
-	whether the framework guiding the EIF on the selection of financial 
intermediaries was complete and ensured fair and transparent selection; 
-	whether the agreement parameters, determining the extent of the EUâ€™s 
intervention, had been correctly set; and
-	whether policy objectives had been correctly translated into the 
guarantee 
agreements.
Well designed selection framework
47.	The appraisal process should apply common standards to evaluating 
financial 
intermediaries, so as to ensure fair, structured and transparent 
selection. The EIF 
and the Commission should create and apply minimum standards for the 
selection 
of potential intermediaries. 
48.	The Commission empowered the EIF  to select intermediaries by 
applying 
the selection criteria and process set out in the relevant guarantee 
policies . The 
guarantee policies further state that the intermediaries are to be 
selected in 
conformity with best practice. An overview of the SMEG selection process 
carried 
out by the EIF is provided in Box 3.
Box 3 â€“ the EIFâ€™s selection process for intermediaries
*	Analysis of intermediariesâ€™ applications following an open call 
procedure
*	Pre-selection of the applications â€“ standardised check on formal 
requirements
*	Due diligence process (including setting of guarantee parameters)
*	Independent opinion of the EIFâ€™s Risk Management Department
*	Assessment by the EIFâ€™s Compliance Department
*	Approval by the EIF Board of Directors and by the European Commission 
(Director ECFIN â€“ L)
49.	When defining the facilityâ€™s management framework, the following 
criteria for 
selecting potential financial intermediaries were laid down in the FMA :
-	financial standing and operational capability of the intermediary and 
its ability 
to manage risk and to comply with the terms and conditions of the SMEG 
facility;
-	whether the intermediary guarantees debt and/or micro-credit 
financing 
provided by a wide range of lenders to SMEs;
-	geographic coverage (loan window only);
-	possibility of providing mentoring and business support (micro credit 
window 
only); and
-	acceptance of the â€œEnhanced Access to Financeâ€ criterion (see 
paragraph 
54).
50.	The Court considers the criteria for the selection of financial 
intermediaries to 
be in line with practices in comparable financial institutions. However, 
neither the 
Commission nor the EIF set scoring standards against which the 
intermediariesâ€™ 
applications could have been assessed, rated and compared according to 
their 
degree of compliance with those criteria. The lack of precision regarding 
the 
selection criteria allowed the EIF to exercise a high level of discretion 
in 
evaluating the applications. 
Insufficient records justifying the agreement parameters 
51.	The two main parameters of the guarantee agreements are the reference 
volume and the guarantee cap rate. The reference volume represents the 
amount 
of guarantees or financing which the intermediary could â€œreasonably be 
expected 
to achieve [â€¦] in the absence of the EU guaranteeâ€ . The reference volume 
further serves as a basis for the computation of additional agreement 
parameters. 
The guarantee cap rate  refers to the maximum amount of losses for which 
the 
EIF is liable under a guarantee agreement. Both parameters are key 
factors as 
they will determine:
(a)	whether the EU intervention is additional to the guarantee schemeâ€™s 
existing 
level of activity or simply replaces it; and
(b)	the maximum level of budgetary exposure the EU is expected to face 
under a 
specific agreement.
52.	In accordance with the FMA and with the Guidance on Enhanced Access 
to 
Finance, the volumes, including the reference volume, are determined on 
the 
basis of the EIFâ€™s professional judgement, based on past budgets and loss 
rates 
or forecasts (especially for public guarantee schemes) and considering 
the market 
conditions and their evolution over time. 
53.	Weaknesses were found in the EIFâ€™s documentation relating to the 
setting of 
the agreement parameters, including the reference volume and the cap 
rate. Only 
a summary of the results of the due-diligence step is included in the 
EIFâ€™s request 
for the Board of Directorsâ€™ approval. When setting these parameters, the 
EIF 
takes as a basis the information provided by the financial intermediary. 
No 
evidence was found that the EIF verified this information.
Policy objectives not fully defined in the guarantee agreements
54.	Each guarantee agreement should contribute to the achievement of the 
policy 
objectives by specifying exactly what should be achieved. The general 
undertakings applicable to every intermediary in the guarantee agreements 
include principles of enhanced access to finance. These principles are 
derived 
from the broader objectives set out in the legal basis  and in the FMA 
and reflect 
these objectives appropriately. Box 4 presents the principles applicable 
to the 
loan window.
Box 4 - Principles of enhanced access to finance as per guarantee 
agreement (loan window)
The purpose of this agreement is the provision of a guarantee by the ElF 
to the 
intermediary in order to partially cover the intermediaryâ€™s portfolio 
risk with a 
view to:

(i) enhancing SMEs' access to finance;
(ii) reducing the particular difficulties that SMEs face in accessing 
finance, 
either due to the perceived higher risk associated with investment in 
certain 
knowledge-related activities such as technological development, 
innovation 
and technology transfer, or due to the lack of sufficient collateral; and
(iii) stimulating job-creation by supporting SMEs with growth and 
employment 
creation.

55.	Besides these general provisions, specific financial intermediary 
guarantee 
terms may include â€œfurther qualitative undertakings in respect of 
enhanced access 
to financeâ€. However, some of the intermediary guarantee terms are 
inconsistent 
with the objectives of the CIP or provide little operational guidance. 
For instance: 
-	in respect of the lack of collateral aspect it was found for one 
intermediary 
that â€œin addition to complying with any relevant provision of this 
agreement 
[â€¦] the intermediary undertakes [â€¦] to require a low collateral level in 
relation 
to intermediary transactionsâ€. In this case the specific terms of the 
agreement 
translate the general conditions relating to the lack of collateral into 
reduced 
collateral requirements. However, this allows de facto all SMEs to 
benefit 
from the reduced collateral requirements and does not ensure that only 
SMEs 
effectively lacking collateral, and thus unable to borrow under usual 
commercial terms, benefit from the facility; and
-	the specific terms of the agreements leave broad discretion in the 
matter of 
interpretation of innovation. The same guarantee agreement stated, 
without 
providing any further explanation, â€œ[â€¦] the intermediary undertakes [â€¦] 
to 
enter into intermediary transactions with newly created SMEs or SMEs 
involved in innovative projectsâ€.
Performance monitoring and reporting
56.	Effective monitoring and reporting requires relevant, reliable and 
timely 
information on the status of the policy implementation and the extent to 
which the 
policy objectives are being met. 
57.	Performance monitoring of the SMEG facility is carried out by both 
the 
Commission and the EIF (see Annex II). The information flows from the 
SMEs 
(i.e. final beneficiaries) through one or more layers (in the case of co- 
or counter-
guarantees) of financial intermediaries to the EIF and finally to the 
Commission. 
Financial intermediaries report to the EIF on a quarterly basis on the 
SMEG 
facility. Based on this information, the EIF prepares quarterly 
consolidated reports 
for the Commission, which then uses these reports for the annual 
implementation 
reports on the EIP and on the CIP. 
58.	The Court examined the following aspects of performance monitoring 
and 
reporting:
-	whether the Commission established a balanced set of performance 
indicators to reliably measure the status of policy implementation; and
-	whether the reporting requirements are clear and reasonable.
Performance indicators were established, but should be more stable and 
balanced
59.	The prerequisite for effective monitoring (i.e. to measure progress 
of the 
implementation of the SMEG facility) is the definition of a set of clear 
indicators 
and associated targets. Indicators should be relatively stable so that 
changes over 
time can be observed and compared. 
60.	The SMEG performance indicators should contribute to an assessment of 
the 
achievement of the programmeâ€™s specific objectives as laid down in the 
legal 
basis and the global objectives of the European Union policy from which 
these 
objectives are derived. 
61.	For SMEG the Commission established six indicators (see Table 4).

2	One job created or maintained for each SME receiving new financing. 
The Commission considers 
that as the data of the Growth and Employment initiative indicate that 
beneficiary SMEs created 
on average 1.2 jobs, a more conservative ratio should be used to account 
for the fact that micro-
credit guarantee corresponds to more than 20 % of all companies reached 
by SMEG and thus, 
fewer jobs are expected to be created by these companies bringing down 
the overall average.
3	The information can be found in the EIF quarterly reports only.
62.	Of the four indicators (numbers 2, 3, 5, and 6) included in the ex-
ante 
evaluation and in the EIP 2009 Work Programme, only two were carried over 
(numbers 2 and 3) to the Commissionâ€™s EIP Implementation Report. In the 
EIP 
2010 Work Programme, two initial indicators were dropped (numbers 5 and 
6) and 
two new indicators were added (numbers 1 and 4). These changes, made in 
2010, were a reaction to a study on the evaluation of the indicators . 
63.	In the ex-ante evaluation only two indicators (numbers 2 and 3) had 
target 
values assigned to them. The EIP 2009 and 2010 Work Programmes did not 
set 
targets for the indicators to achieve in the respective period. In the 
absence of 
target values, it is difficult to assess whether the programme is 
developing as 
expected.
64.	Even though the Commission tried to create a balanced set of 
measurable 
indicators, including output, impact and result indicators, the only 
result indicator 
(number 5) was not carried over and was finally dropped by the 
Commission. The 
only impact indicator (number 2) is problematic (see paragraphs 67 and 
68) and 
all remaining indicators are output indicators. Thus, the indicators have 
become 
more of an instrument of operational management than an indicator to 
measure 
the impact and the success of the programme. It is difficult to strike 
the right 
balance between collecting the data economically and monitoring 
performance 
effectively. The evaluators of the EIP indicators suggested a set of 
balanced 
indicators including data collection methods and timing . 
65.	If meaningful conclusions as to the achievements of the SMEG 
programme 
are to be drawn, it is essential that the monitoring data provided by the 
financial 
intermediaries should be reliable, i.e. accurate and complete. 
66.	The financial intermediaries visited by the Court had all established 
procedures for collecting the data necessary for reporting to the EIF. 
The quality 
of the reporting processes at intermediary level is checked during the 
on-site 
monitoring visits by the EIF. 
67.	The collection of data related to â€œthe number of jobs createdâ€ 
indicator poses 
difficulties for some financial intermediaries. In some countries the 
data are 
obtained from governmental institutions , some financial intermediaries 
collected 
them on a sample basis , others made calculations using expected values  
or 
the financial intermediaries did not update employment data annually as 
it would 
be too burdensome . Since the quality of employment data varies from 
country to 
country, adding them up raises concerns as to the reliability of the 
value of the 
indicator concerning the number of jobs created (number 2).
68.	Another problem with this indicator is that the values are taken from 
the 
number of persons employed by the supported SMEs, which is not equivalent 
to 
the number of jobs created or maintained at SMEs receiving new financing. 
The 
new financing received by an SME is not the only factor which leads to 
maintaining or creating jobs. There is no analysis as to how the 
guaranteed loan 
contributed to maintaining or creating jobs. 
Reporting requirements are clear and reasonable and only some financial 
intermediaries consider them a burden
69.	Financial intermediaries should have clear reporting requirements in 
order to 
collect the data for monitoring and reporting on the SMEG programme. Time 
and 
resources to obtain the required information for the indicators should 
not create an 
unnecessary administrative burden. 
70.	Financial intermediaries are required to collect various data on the 
supported 
SMEs and report to the EIF on a regular basis (see Annex III). Reporting 
requirements are listed in the guarantee agreement between the EIF and 
the 
financial intermediary. To this end, clear guidelines  have been issued 
by the EIF 
to the financial intermediaries as to how to compile the requested data. 
Corroborating this statement, 88 % of the financial intermediaries agreed 
that the 
operational instructions provided by the EIF were clear . Furthermore, 98 
% of 
the financial intermediaries stated that the EIF is always willing to 
provide further 
information to clarify operational issues . 
71.	The results of the Courtâ€™s questionnaire also showed that only 20 % 
of 
financial intermediaries participating under the CIP and/or the MAP find 
the 
reporting requirements unreasonable . 
72.	In cases where data collection through financial intermediaries poses 
a lot of 
difficulties (for example, employment data), alternative methods of 
collecting 
information could have been more appropriate. Both reports, â€œEvaluation 
of the 
Indicators of the EIPâ€ and the â€œInterim evaluation of the EIPâ€, suggested 
using 
surveys in the context of an evaluation.
Achievements of the SMEG facility
73.	This section describes the outputs delivered by the SMEG facility. 
The outputs 
are analysed in relation to the facilityâ€™s objectives. Furthermore, the 
European 
added value of the facility is examined, in particular whether the 
facilityâ€™s 
objectives are better achieved by implementation at Community level than 
at 
national or regional level.
Outputs of the SMEG facility
74.	The CIP financial instruments should â€œimprove (â€¦) access to finance 
for the 
start-up and growth of SMEs and investment in innovation activities â€. 
More 
specifically, the SMEG facility under CIP sets out to: 
-	reach 315 750 SMEs ;
-	guarantee loans that finance SMEsâ€™ innovative investments  or are 
provided 
to SMEs lacking sufficient collateral; and therefore
-	enhance access to finance where the market fails.
75.	The following analysis was based on a review of the loan sample 
selected by 
the Court . As regards investments in certain knowledge-related 
activities such 
as technological development, innovation and technology transfer, 
reference is 
made to the OECD Oslo Manual for the measurement of scientific and 
technological activities . 
The overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs is attainable
76.	All financial intermediaries visited clearly targeted SMEs and all 
had 
procedures in place to verify the SME status of the borrower.
77.	As regards the overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs , the 
Commission 
and the EIF made a successful effort to overcome the consequences of the 
initial 
delay (see paragraph 32) by concentrating on the larger financial 
intermediaries. 
In the three years since the CIP came in force, the EIF has signed 25 
deals with 
21 financial intermediaries (see Table 2). At the end of 2009, the total 
guarantee 
cap amount  of these guarantee agreements stood at 191,1 million euro, 
representing 37,5 % of the overall budget for the SMEG facility. The 
financial 
intermediaries had provided loans to almost 59 000 SMEs, representing 19 
% of 
the target number of SMEs. Taking into account the results from the MAP, 
the 
signed guarantee agreements reach more than half of the target number of 
SMEs 
(57,4 %) if the maximum portfolio amount is reached for each of these 
agreements  (see Figure 3). Therefore, the progress in implementation is 
sufficient to expect that the overall target of reaching 315 750 SMEs 
will be 
attained.

The facility reaches SMEs which lack collateral; innovative projects are 
scarce
78.	The SMEG facility is designed to enhance access to debt funding for 
SMEs 
that have viable projects but are unable to secure a loan from commercial 
lenders. 
Such a situation can occur if an SME does not have sufficient collateral 
to fulfil the 
requirements of a commercial lender. Alternatively, the SME can be denied 
access to loan financing if the commercial lenders are not in a position 
to easily 
estimate the viability of the business proposition, as might be the case 
for 
innovative investments. The more novel the investment, the less likely it 
is that a 
loan will be granted.
79.	Based on the responses to the Courtâ€™s questionnaire, the CIP 
financial 
intermediaries aimed to target primarily SMEs without sufficient 
collateral, 
secondly micro enterprises and then start-ups. The innovative SMEs 
represent 
the category that is least targeted. While 90 % of the intermediaries 
agreed with 
the statement that their CIP-guaranteed product was aimed at customers 
that did 
not have sufficient collateral, only approximately half of the 
intermediaries agreed 
with the statement that their CIP-guaranteed product was aimed at 
innovative 
SMEs (see Figure 4).
Figure 4 - Survey of Financial Intermediaries â€“ SMEs targeted by the 
guarantee/loan product
 
Source: ECA questionnaire to the financial intermediaries.
80.	The analysis of the loan sample shows that SMEs with a lack of 
collateral 
benefited more often than SMEs that were carrying out innovative 
investments. 
Out of the 181 loans in the sample, 77 loans (43 %) were provided to SMEs 
that 
lacked sufficient collateral to gain access to finance through existing 
commercial 
lending. Only 22 loans (12 %) were used to finance projects that had 
innovative 
aspects (see Table 5).

1 In the cases where a financial intermediary defined the level of 
sufficient collateral or this level 
could be implicitly deduced, this was applied to determine the 
â€œsufficiencyâ€ of the collateral. In the 
remaining cases, an SME was considered to possess sufficient collateral 
if the loan amount did 
not exceed 70 % of the value of realisable assets. In the latter 
category, other factors which 
increased the risk profile of the SME were also taken into account (e.g. 
loans to unemployed) and 
as a result these SMEs were considered as â€œSMEs that lack sufficient 
collateralâ€.
Source: European Court of Auditors.
81.	Although innovative investments were rare, the loan sample included 
some 
highly innovative investments. Half of the innovative projects (11 out of 
22) were 
assessed as market-new or world-new types of innovation. These projects 
aimed 
at creating new or significantly improved products, production processes 
or 
delivery methods that were new at least for the operating market of the 
enterprise. 
For an example of such an investment, see Box 5. The remaining innovative 
investments could be described as a novelty only for the enterprise 
concerned, 
and were already being implemented by other firms that were directly 
competing 
with the borrower.


Box 5 - Example of an innovative project
The entrepreneur did not have sufficient collateral to secure a normal 
commercial 
loan of 40 000 euro. However, in his previous job as a researcher he had 
acquired 
significant knowledge about the production of vinegar. He therefore, used 
the 
guaranteed loan to start up a company producing high-quality vinegar. The 
production process used specifically cultivated bacteria that made the 
fermentation process more stable. The resulting vinegar had a better 
taste and 
higher sugar content â€“ qualities appreciated by consumers. The companyâ€™s 
operating market was regional and there were no other competitors using 
the 
same production process.
82.	However, for 23 loans no assessment could be made regarding the 
reported 
lack of collateral due to the absence of information at the financial 
intermediaries. 
Financial intermediaries strive for additional lending volumes, but more 
attention 
could have been paid to deadweight
83.	In guarantee schemes, â€œdeadweightâ€ occurs if the borrower could have 
obtained the loan from commercial lenders without public support. In such 
situations, the effects, such as creation of jobs, economic or innovation 
activity, 
would have been realised anyway. Publicly supported guarantee schemes are 
most effective when the financed investment would otherwise not have been 
carried out, and the desired effects would not have been realised. 
84.	To ensure that the SMEG facility provides additional access to 
finance for 
SMEs, the Commission has developed Guidance on Enhanced Access to 
Finance. This aims to ensure that the financial intermediary can use the 
portfolio 
guarantee only after the actual lending volume exceeds the lending volume 
that 
the intermediary would have achieved without the guarantee. This concept 
of 
additionality is simple to use and can be easily embedded into the 
guarantee 
agreement.
85.	However, additionality does not ensure that the additional volume at 
the level 
of the financial intermediary is also additional at the level of the 
economy. In the 
context of the SMEG facility, it is considered that deadweight occurs if 
guarantees 
are provided for loans to SMEs with sufficient collateral and without 
innovative 
investments. However, when providing assistance on protfolio basis, a 
certain 
level of deadweight is inevitable. The loan analysis revealed deadweight 
in more 
than a third of the loans in the sample (38 %, 69 out of 181, see Table 
5). Other 
things being equal, these borrowers could have obtained the loans from 
commercial lenders without the SME guarantee. A survey of the MAP 
borrowers 
conducted by the interim evaluator showed a similar level of deadweight .
Specific lending conditions
86.	Each guarantee agreement between the EIF and the financial 
intermediary 
contains a standard clause listing the principles of enhanced access to 
finance 
(see paragraph 54) for the benefit of SMEs without collateral or with 
innovative 
investments. There is not always a clear indication as to how the 
financial 
intermediary intends to target them. Some financial intermediaries used 
specific 
lending conditions to attract such SMEs, thus minimising deadweight (see 
Box 6).
Box 6 - Lending conditions to attract either innovative SMEs or SMEs 
without 
sufficient collateral 
*	The guaranteed loans can be provided only to start-ups and SMEs with 
a short 
business history
*	Ceiling on the loan amount
*	Providing non-monetary benefits to the SMEs  so that the guaranteed 
loans 
are not cheaper than non-guaranteed loans
*	Higher guarantee rates for investments that are innovative or 
constitute to 
some extent a novelty

87.	While the first three lending conditions will lead to automatic 
preference for 
borrowers that lack collateral, the last condition will probably increase 
the interest 
of innovative SMEs. The relative absence of lending conditions geared 
towards 
innovative SMEs may explain the low number of innovative investments 
found in 
the sample (see Table 5).
European added value
88.	As all the fields covered by the CIP are the shared responsibility of 
the 
Member States and the Community , the SMEG facility also has to respect 
the 
subsidiarity principle stipulated in Article 5 of the Treaty. EU actions 
not falling 
within the exclusive competence of the Union, such as the SMEG facility, 
should 
be undertaken only if, and in so far, as the objectives of the proposed 
action 
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by 
reason 
of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at the 
EU level.
89.	The concept of subsidiarity is reiterated in a recital preceding the 
CIP 
decision , in the CIP proposal  and in the CIP impact assessment . In 
essence, 
the arguments used by the Commission in favour of the EU dimension of the 
financial instruments can be grouped under two headings:
-	ensuring coherence in implementation; and 
-	the global nature of competition and innovation.
The SMEG facility may have sizeable non-monetary benefits for an 
intermediary; 
however consistency of implementation is not actively striven for
90.	In its CIP preparatory documents, the Commission argued that the 
European 
dimension would ensure diffusion of good practice in the delivery of 
financial 
instruments, including the SMEG facility. Although similar measures exist 
in some 
Member States, the Community intervention will contribute to the 
consistency of 
implementation.
91.	Several cases were found in which the financing from the EU budget 
was 
crucial, not only as a partial coverage of the credit losses, but also 
because it 
allowed the intermediary to try something new. In two instances the SMEG 
facility 
helped with the development of guarantee or lending products that were 
new to 
the intermediary. For one of them, multiple attempts had to be made until 
the 
product gained sufficient recognition from the on-lending banks and the 
clients. It 
can be assumed that the product would not have been developed if the EIF 
and 
the Commission had not repeatedly collaborated with that intermediary. 
Furthermore, cooperation with the EU institutions may help smaller 
private 
financial intermediaries especially to gain recognition among the on-
lending banks 
and/or their clients. 
92.	This is corroborated by the result of the questionnaire sent to the 
financial 
intermediaries. 6 out of 31 CIP intermediaries  have developed a new loan 
or 
guarantee product and 16 out of 31 have significantly modified their 
existing 
products to participate in the CIP. 
93.	The SMEG facility increases the visibility of EU support among 
financial 
intermediaries. The audit visits showed that awareness of the EU 
guarantees 
among SMEs was not very high. However, actively driven attempts to ensure 
consistency between the practices of different intermediaries were not 
observed. 
The EIF simply collects the information about the practices of the 
financial 
intermediaries, but does not question these practices. As has been shown 
in the 
case of lending conditions (see paragraph 86), a more active approach by 
the EIF 
might improve take-up of the facility by SMEs with innovative projects or 
insufficient collateral.
The SMEG facility increases the competitiveness of individual 
enterprises; this 
does not imply that EU added value is delivered
94.	This aspect of EU added value is directly related to one of the CIP 
global 
objectives: â€œto foster the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular 
of SMEsâ€ . 
In the preparatory documents, the Commission argued that the competition 
European firms face is increasingly global and innovation is seen as a 
global 
phenomenon that is not successful and sustainable in a closed 
environment.
95.	The loan analysis showed that the SMEG facility does indeed help 
individual 
enterprises to increase their competitiveness. It was found that 74 out 
of 
181 loans (41 %) were directly used to increase the enterpriseâ€™s 
competitiveness . The SMEG facility delivers many other valuable results 
in 
relation to the creation of a more competitive environment. It enables 
small start-
ups - mainly in the service sector - to emerge. Out of the 181 loans in 
the sample, 
26 loans (14 %) were used to start a new business and 15 loans (8 %) were 
used 
to finance post-start-up expansions of the business . It also helps to 
maintain the 
competitive landscape allowing individuals to become entrepreneurs by 
buying an 
existing SME (47 loans, 26 %).
96.	However, the EU added value of these results is not conclusive as the 
same 
effects could be achieved with funding from national budgets. For 
instance, the 
Commission  gives three suggestions on how an EU policy may impact 
competitiveness at the EU level . The EU policy might:
-	have an impact on the competitive position of EU firms in comparison 
with 
their non-EU rivals;
-	stimulate cross-border investment flows, including relocation of 
economic 
activity; or 
-	be necessary to correct undesirable outcomes of market processes in 
European markets.
97.	None of these effects were observed during the audit. The loan 
analysis 
confirmed that most of the SMEs are operating in local, regional or 
national 
markets. 19 out of 181 loans (10 %) were provided to SMEs that had some 
cross-
border activities and 13 loans (7 %) were used for investments that had a 
significant cross-border element . The scarcity of cross-border 
activities is not 
surprising given the types of businesses of the SMEs in the sample (for 
an 
overview, see Figure 5): 17 restaurants, 8 taxi drivers, 41 small retail 
shops 
(bakery, butcher, newspaper shop or supermarket) or 17 craftsmen 
(carpenter, 
electrician, mason or roofer). Given these examples of borrowers whose 
businesses are usually local, the need for EU intervention is not 
sufficiently 
demonstrated.

Source: European Court of Auditors.
98.	Indeed, the scale of the individual guarantee deals does not go 
beyond 
national borders. In essence the SMEG facility operates as a set of 
national 
guarantee schemes, because there are significant differences between the 
national debt markets . These differences are caused by cultural as well 
as legal 
constraints and are so significant that the debt markets can be 
considered to be 
purely national.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Design of the SMEG facility
99.	Although no explicit intervention logic was provided in the CIP 
preparatory 
documents for the SMEG facility, an implicit intervention logic can be 
found in the 
different preparatory documents of the CIP Decision. However, there is no 
conceptual link between the problem at stake and the expected results and 
impacts as presented before the start of the intervention. Although the 
objectives 
are now more precise than under the previous MAP programme, they are only 
specific, measurable, achievable and timed in relation to the expected 
outputs. 
Recommendation 1
Future SME support programmes should be based upon an explicit 
intervention 
logic linking the inputs to the expected outputs, results and impacts. 
Setting the management structure
100.	Overall an appropriate framework has been established for the 
management 
of the SMEG facility. The fee structure has been improved compared to MAP 
by 
adding performance triggered incentives. However, delays in the planning 
of the 
facility prevented effective budget allocation during the first year and 
caused an 
interruption of the support for some financial intermediaries.
Recommendation 2
For the purpose of planning any subsequent facility, the Court recommends 
finalising the legal basis and the management agreement well before the 
effective 
start of the programming period in order to have time to select adequate 
financial 
intermediaries and to complete contract negotiations with them by the 
effective 
start of the programming period, thus avoiding the need to have recourse 
to any 
retroactivity clause in the future.
Selection of financial intermediaries
101.	The Commission devised appropriate procedures for the selection of 
financial intermediaries. However, no scoring standards were established 
to rate 
the applications from the different potential intermediaries and no 
minimum 
requirements are defined for the different selection criteria. Weaknesses 
were 
found in the documentation of the parameters setting in the guarantee 
agreements with financial intermediaries. 
Recommendation 3
To enhance the transparency of the selection, a scoring system for the 
assessment of potential intermediary applications should be put in place 
for any 
successor programme. Minimum requirements should be defined for the 
selection 
of financial intermediaries. The calculation of the parameters in the 
guarantee 
agreements should be documented in greater detail. 
Performance monitoring and reporting 
102.	Sufficient output indicators were established which were used to 
report on  
SMEGâ€™s implementation. The data for the only impact indicator which 
refers to the 
â€œnumber of jobs createdâ€ is difficult to collect and, due to varying 
calculation 
methods, not comparable between countries. Reporting requirements are 
clear 
and not perceived as a burden by a majority of the financial 
intermediaries 
participating in SMEG.
Recommendation 4
The Commission should consider the scope for creating additional or 
better 
performance indicators in order to monitor better the achievements of the 
facilityâ€™s 
objectives and draw appropriate conclusions. 
Achievements of the SMEG facility
103.	The only quantified target, that of reaching 315 750 SMEs, is 
likely to be 
achieved. The analysis of the Courtâ€™s sample of loans showed that less 
than half 
of the loans (43 %) were given to SMEs that had a lack of sufficient 
collateral and 
only 12 % used the loans for innovative investments. The loan analysis 
revealed a 
deadweight of 38 %, i.e. loans made to SMEs with sufficient collateral 
and not 
using them for innovation.
Recommendation 5
The Commission should in future set more specific targets which better 
reflect the 
objectives of the financial instrument. During the lifetime of the 
instrument 
monitoring should measure progress towards achieving such targets, 
allowing 
remedial action to be taken as necessary. Appropriate measures to 
minimise 
deadweight should be envisaged, drawing inter alia on best practices 
already in 
place at certain intermediaries.
104.	The SMEG facility enabled some financial intermediaries to develop 
and 
offer new lending or guarantee products, but no active identification and 
dissemination of good practices is undertaken. The EU added value of SMEG 
is 
not demonstrated as the results from SMEG might also have been achieved 
by 
funding under national schemes. Significant cross-border investments or 
effects of 
the SMEG loans were not observed. 
Recommendation 6
As the Court emphasised in the past, expenditure from the Union budget 
must 
offer clear and visible benefits for the EU and for its citizens which 
could not be 
achieved by spending only at national, regional or local level.  The 
Budgetary 
authorities and the Commission should therefore consider how EU added 
value 
could be maximised in any successor to the SMEG facility.

volume by the guarantee rate and the guarantee cap rate. E.g. portfolio 
volume =

Executive summary 
About Absorption
The aim of Cohesion policy is to reduce development imbalances between regions in the European Union. It accounts for around a third of the EU budget, implemented through Operational Programmes (OPs). The funds are made available at the start of a multiannual programme period. Absorption capacity refers to a Member Stateâ€™s ability to efficiently and effectively spend the financial resources it has been allocated. Member States absorb funding when they receive a payment from the EU budget as co-financing towards eligible projects. To maintain a focus on achieving effective results, it is crucial that Member States avoid a situation where a significant amount of funds needs to be absorbed at the end of the programme period, since the rush to absorb funds may lead to insufficient consideration to value for money. Thus, while absorption is important to achieve policy objectives, it is not an end in itself.
How we conducted the audit
We examined whether the Commissionâ€™s and Member Statesâ€™ actions were effective in absorbing funding from the ERDF, ESF and CF during the 2007-2013 programme period. We carried out audit visits to four Member States: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Romania. The audit covered the 2007-2013 programme period. However, we make comparisons with the 2000-2006 and 2014-2020 programme periods and highlight risks concerning absorption for the current period.
What we found
We found that, for both the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods the late adoption of the legislative framework, six months and two weeks prior to the start of the programme periods respectively, meant late adoption of the OPs. For both periods, most of the OPs were not adopted until after one year into the programme period. This had an inevitable knock-on effect on the start of spending of the allocated funds. 
Implementation had started slowly in the 2007-2013 period but was even slower for 2014-2020. Beside the above knock-on effect the overlap of programme periods was one further reason for the slow start as this meant that Member States were still spending the previous periodâ€™s funding after the subsequent programme had started.
During the 2007-2013 programme period, the Commission did monitor the absorption of funds, but only around 13 months before the end of the eligibility period did it put in place a Task Force to assist Member States with poorly absorbing OPs. Eight Member States received support from the Task Force for Better Implementation. The measures taken led to a marked increase in absorption for the assisted Member States. At the start of 2018 the average EU absorption rate stood at 97.2Â %. Several Member States did not manage to use all the funding available and unused funding at the end of 2017 amounted to 4.4 billion euros. The final absorption rate and the final value of unused funding will be known once closure is complete. 
Measures used to increase absorption include: OP revisions, splitting projects into phases between programme periods, co-financing projects retrospectively, advances to financial instruments and contractual advances. Some of these measures focussed mainly on absorption and compliance with rules with little consideration for results. In particular, OPs were frequently revised calling into question the soundness of the analyses underlying the programming process and subsequent revisions and the ability to achieve the OP and Cohesion policy objectives. 
The Commission does not have a comprehensive overview of all the measures used and the impact of each measure on absorption, due to insufficient information provided by Member States and because for some measures (such as retrospective projects and contractual advances) the legislative framework does not require Member States to report to the Commission.
What we recommend
The Commission should:
propose to the Council and the European Parliament a timetable for negotiation and adoption of the legislative framework and programme documents with a view to ensure that OP implementation can start at the beginning of the programme period;
where key elements of performance are affected, ensure that revisions of OPs are based on a sound and comprehensive assessment of the OPs and partnership agreements and related needs and that the revision is primarily undertaken to provide better results; ensure that it has the means to obtain information allowing it to monitor absorption, identify slow and rapid absorption and assess ex-ante the need and the impact of measures to know whether to use them or not; and 
when providing targeted support to accelerate implementation ensure that actions are undertaken with a focus on delivery of good results.


Introduction
Policy objectives, funding and management
The aim of Cohesion policy is to reduce development imbalances between regions, restructure declining industrial areas and encourage crossâ€border, transnational and interregional cooperation in the European Union. To achieve these aims, EU funds are used to develop various areas such as the low carbon economy, transport infrastructure, support for SMEs, integration of people into the labour market and social inclusion of the disadvantaged. 
The multiannual financial framework (MFF) outlines the maximum annual amounts which the EU may spend for different policies, including Cohesion. Around a third of the EU budget is allocated to Cohesion policy. Cohesion policy is delivered through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF). In current prices, the total allocation to the ERDF, ESF and CF mounted to around 261 billion euros in the 2000â€2006 programme period, 346 billion euros in 2007â€2013 and some 365Â billion euros in 2014â€2020. The relevant amount of Cohesion funding is then pre-allocated among the Member States. 
The rules governing Cohesion policy during the 2007-2013 programme period are laid down in a General Regulation and its implementing rules, and fund-specific regulations concerning the ERDF, ESF and the CF. These are complemented by Commission implementing regulations, delegated acts and guidance documents. A new legislative package is adopted for every programme period.
These funds are implemented through Operational Programmes (OPs), which set out the investment priorities and specific objectives. These also describe how funding will be used during the programme period to finance projects. Member States allocate their national envelope to the different national or regional OPs in line with their national strategic and EU Cohesion objectives. 
Implementation of Cohesion policy is shared by the Member States and the Commission. The current Commission College commenced its five year term in November 2014. The Commission services responsible for overall management of these policy areas are the Directorates-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO) and Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). They may provide the Member States with administrative and technical support in order to ensure that funds are implemented properly. In the Member States, national and/or regional Cohesion programme authorities are tasked with achieving value for money with the allocated EU funds and ensuring the legality and regularity of co-financed operations under the Commissionâ€™s supervision and final responsibility.
The main phases of a programme period are outlined in Figure 1. For each programme period, a new legislative framework is adopted, followed by the submission and adoption of the programming documents. Implementation can start from the 1 January of the first year of the programming period or when the OP is submitted to the Commission for approval (whichever is earlier). However, payments from the EU budget towards an OP) can start only once the OP has been adopted. Therefore, delays in adopting the legal framework or OPs have a knock-on effect on payments from the EU budget. Finally, closure is the last stage in the OP lifecycle and results in a final payment or recovery of funds unduly paid.
The timeline for these phases is not confined to the period 2007 to 2013. For instance part of the implementation and closure of the 2007-2013 programme period occurred after 2013, after the 2014-2020 period had already started. Thus, there was an overlap between programme periods.
Figure 1 â€“ Main phases in the 2007-2013 programme period 

The funding allocated to an OP is divided into annual instalments over the seven-year programme period. Each instalment gives rise to a budgetary commitment, which represents EU funding set aside for an OP which is used to co-finance eligible expenditure on projects. Such expenditure incurred by a beneficiary will result in an application for reimbursement made by a Member State to the Commission, which will then authorise a payment from the commitments. Funds are considered to be absorbed once the Commission makes a payment. 
During the 2007-2013 programme period, commitments had to be used (i.e. they had to be covered by a pre-financing or an interim payment) within two years, i.e. expenditure by beneficiaries could be paid until 31 December 2015 with applications for reimbursement made subsequently. Funding was de-committed i.e. it could no longer be spent by the Member States if it was not used within two years; this is known as the â€˜n+2 ruleâ€™. The n+2 rule was extended by one year (i.e. n+3) for certain Member States for certain commitment instalments.
Audit scope and approach
The purpose of this audit was to assess whether the Commissionâ€™s and Member Statesâ€™ actions were effective in absorbing funding from the ERDF, ESF and CF during the 2007-2013 programme period. In particular, we examined whether:
the Commission detected absorption difficulties and addressed them in a timely manner through measures aiming to improve absorption and by supporting Member States in implementing them; 
the Member States used these measures with due consideration to compliance and value for money (see Box 1).
While the audit covered the 2007-2013 programme period references are also made to the 2000-2006 and 2014-2020 periods. Such references are made for comparison purposes and to highlight risks concerning absorption for the current period.
Our audit work comprised: 
an analysis of provisions in the legal framework of the 2007-2013 programme period which impact absorption;
a review of relevant Commission technical guidelines on the implementation of certain legal provisions affecting absorption and on closure;
an assessment of Commission monitoring procedures for the 2007-2013 programme period relating to absorption, including the work done by the Task Force for Better Implementation;
an analysis of 16 ERDF and CF OPs and four ESF OPs from seven Member States: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Of these OPs, seven ERDF and CF OPs and two ESF OPs were reviewed in depth. A list of the OPs covered is included in Annex 1;
audit visits to four Member States: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Romania;
interviews with officials from DG REGIO and DG EMPL, including those who participated in the Task Force for Better Implementation.
Box 1 - Absorption is a means to achieve results and not an end in itself
Absorption capacity refers to a Member Stateâ€™s ability to efficiently and effectively spend the financial resources it has been allocated.The Court has already noted that it is an ongoing challenge for the Union to obtain good qualitative results from schemes where funds are pre-allocated among Member States and absorption is an implicit objective. We also reported that the 2007-2013 legislative framework focused primarily on spending in line with the rules, with limited focus on performance.
Absorption should not be an end in itself, but rather a means of investing in actions to help achieve national and EU policy objectives. Cohesion policy funding is significant and should bring important benefits to EU citizens. In order to do so, it is particularly important that funding is spent in a way that represents value for money.
Observations 
The Commission reacted late to slow implementation but its actions helped increase absorption 
We compared the timing of the adoption of the legal framework for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods to determine how much time Member States had before the start of the programme period to submit OPs. We looked at the timing of the adoption of the OPs for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods to determine when Member States could start absorbing funds. We also looked at the absorption rates in the 2000-2006, 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods to identify similarities in the spending patterns and what can be expected in the current period. Lastly, we assessed how the Commission monitored absorption during the 2007-2013 period, whether it took timely action and what the results were.
Late adoption of the legislative framework and slow implementation resulting in increased pressure to absorb funds
. The adoption of the legislative framework is an essential pre-requisite for the preparation of OPs, because it establishes the regulatory framework and provides legal certainty to Member States that their spending plans and objectives as set in the OPs are in line with EU objectives. In turn, the adoption of the OPs by the Commission marks the start of payments from the EU budget towards an OP. To ensure that spending can commence at the start of the period, it is necessary that the Commission proposes and the legislator adopts, the legislative framework for an upcoming programme period well before it is due to start. Based on previous experience we estimate that a reasonable time-frame would be as follows:
the Commission proposes the legislative framework 30 months (two-and-a-half years) before the start of the period; 
the legislator adopts the framework within 18 months of the Commission proposal;
 the Member States submit, and the Commission adopts, the national strategies (which were partnership agreements for the 2014-2020 programme period) and OPs within one year of the adoption of the legal framework. 
This is important in order to avoid a backlog in implementation and undue pressure to absorb funding towards the end of the period, possibly at the expense of observing the rules and achieving good value for money.
Late adoption of the legislative framework and OPs had a knock-on effect on implementation
For the 2007-2013 period the Commissionâ€™s proposal for the General Regulation was presented nearly 30 months before the start of the programme period and was adopted by the legislator nearly 24 months later, i.e. almost six months before the start of the period. For the 2014-2020 programme period, the Commissionâ€™s proposal for the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) was presented nearly 27 months before the start of the programme period, and it took the legislator over 26 months to adopt it, i.e. only two weeks before the start of the programme period. An overview of the timeline of the legislative procedure is provided in Figure 2.
Compared to the 2007-2013 programme period, the additional time taken to adopt the 2014-2020 Common Provisions Regulation was due to: 
The Commissionâ€™s legislative proposal was presented three months later (i.e. October 2011 compared to July 2004); 
The negotiation process between the Council and the European Parliament took two-and-a-half month longer due to the need to wait for the adoption of the Financial Regulation (in October 2012) and of the MFF (adopted only in December 2013) and negotiations as a result of a new legislative procedure. 
In its communication on the post-2020 MFF the Commission acknowledged that the late adoption of the 2014-2020 MFF delayed investments on the ground in various policy areas (including Cohesion). The Commission has encouraged an early political agreement on the post-2020 MFF in order to provide legal and financial certainty to the national and regional authorities and enable implementation to start immediately at the start of the programme period.

Source: ECA.
For the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods no OPs had been adopted by the time the programme period commenced on 1 January 2007 and 2014, respectively. For the 2007-2013 period a bigger number of OPs were adopted by the end of the first year of the programme period compared to the 2014-2020 period (see Box 2). This is mainly due to the delayed adoption of the legislative package and possibly more demanding negotiations for adopting Partnership Agreements and OPs than in the previous period .
Box 2 â€“ 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 OPs adopted after the programme periods had started
For the 2007-2013 programme period, 98Â % (432 of 440) of the OPs had been submitted and 95Â % (416 of 440 OPs) had been adopted by the Commission by 31 December 2007. The bulk of the OPs (91Â %) were adopted between July and December 2007. The average time from date of submission to adoption of an OP was around seven months. 
For the 2014-2020 programme period, 95.5Â % (371 of 387) of the OPs had been submitted by the Member States and only 55.8Â % (216 of 387 OPs) had been adopted by the Commission by 31 December 2014. The average time taken from date of submission to adoption of an OP was around eight months. 
Absorption during the first years was slow
The annual spending pattern for the 2007-2013 programme period is shown in Figure 3. Commitments at the start of the period are far bigger than payments, as Member States were still drawing upon commitments available from the 2000-2006 programme period, OPs were still being adopted or project selection procedures were still being finalised. By the end of the 2007-2013 programme period, with two years left until the end of the eligibility period (on 31 December 2015), less than two-thirds of commitments had been absorbed by payments.

A comparison of absorption patterns for the 2000-2006 and 2007-2013 programme periods indicate similar profiles. For the 2014-2020 programme period absorption as of end 2017 (year 4 into the programme period) is slower. Figure 4 shows the cumulative absorption rate during these three programme periods from the start of the period (year 1) to the year when the closure declaration should be submitted (year 11).

Source: ECA, based on Commission data.
Besides the late adoption of the legislative framework and OPs, we identified at least two more factors that led to slow absorption in the first years of the 2007-2013 programme period compared to the previous period. Firstly, for the 2000-2006 programme period, the expenditure eligibility period - and therefore the deadline for closure - were extended by six months (up to June 2009 and September 2010 respectively) for most Member States. This delayed implementation of the 2007-2013 programme period, as Member States were still using the commitments available from the previous period. Secondly, during the 2000-2006 period, pre-financing was made in full once the first commitment had been made, whereas in the 2007-2013 programme period, this was staggered over the years 2007 to 2009.
The Court has already reported on the risk that delays in budgetary execution for the 2014-2020 period could be greater than those for the 2007-2013 period. At the end of 2016 (three years into the programme period), only 77Â % of authorities had been designated for the ERDF, ESF and CF OPs. This aggravated the already slow start (see paragraphs 16, 19 and Box 2), because while Member States authorities may launch calls and select projects, they cannot submit statements of expenditure to the Commission until they have been designated. As of May 2018, the designation process was nearly completed. 
As of 1 March 2018, the first, second and third final accounts submitted by the Member States show cumulative expenditure amounting to only around 5Â°% of the budget allocated for the entire programme period. 
The Commission reported that the rate of project selection for the 2014-2020 programme period started slowly. However, by July 2017, it had reached the same levels as in the previous period and from then on, the Commission expects implementation rates to be broadly similar to the 2007-2013 programme period. However, given the absorption difficulties in the 2007-2013 programme period and the slower start of the 2014-2020 period, it is likely that absorption difficulties will also be encountered in 2014-2020. 
The Court noted that for nine Member States outstanding commitments on 2014-2020 ESI funds at the end of 2016 represented more than 15Â % of 2016 general government spending. Given the sizeable commitment appropriations still available under the 2014-2020 MFF, Member States where ESI funds represent a significant percentage of general government spending may find it challenging to identify sufficient high-quality projects on which to spend the available funding or to provide co-financing.
In the 2007-2013 programme period absorption patterns varied across Member States and several did not manage to use all the funding available
Our examination of the absorption by Member States for the 2007 - 2013 programme period shows that some Member States absorbed the funds more quickly than others. However, we note that absorption is a means to achieve objectives and results, but not an end in itself. Figure 5 shows the disparities in absorption rate across Member States. 
Figure 5 â€“ Absorption rate by Member State compared to EU average for the 2007-2013 programme period for the ERDF, ESF and CF

Note: When considering the Member Statesâ€™ absorption pattern for the 2007-2013 programme period we took account of payments made between 2009 and 2015. Payments made during 2007 and 2008 were not included as they are practically only pre-financing payments. Payments made during the 2014 and 2015 were included on the basis of the n+2 rule. 
Source: ECA based on Commission data as of February 2018.
Based on information available from the Commission at the start of 2018 the average EU absorption rate stood at 97.2Â %. Some Member States did not manage to use the funding available within the stipulated time (n+2/3 rule) or did not have sufficient eligible expenditure to claim all allocated funds at closure (see Figure 6). Based on information provided by the Commission unused funding at the end of 2017 amounted to 4.4 billion euros. Projects suspended due to administrative or judicial proceedings amounted to around 853.8 million euros and their absorption by the Member State will depend on the outcome of the proceedings. The final absorption rate and the total value of unused funding can only be confirmed once all OPs have been closed and any financial corrections and recoveries have been determined.

The Commissionâ€™s action to address absorption difficulties was late, but its actions still had an impact on absorption
The Commission should monitor on a regular basis the implementation of the budget and take appropriate action when implementation delays are detected. In addition, it should take advantage of lessons learned from previous programme periods to improve implementation of the funds.
The Commission monitored the implementation of the budget regularly
The Commission has various sources of information for monitoring the implementation of EU funds in the Member States. For the 2007-2013 programme period, the Managing Authority prepared and submitted Annual Implementation Reports (AIR) for each OP to the Commission by 30 June of the following year, starting in June 2008. 
The General Regulation identifies the information to be included in the AIR, namely information on financial implementation, the progress made in reaching the target set, and any significant problems encountered and associated mitigation measures. The information from the AIRs is complemented by statements of eligible expenditure. Member States also reported payment request forecasts biannually. The Commission obtained further information during Monitoring Committee meetings (twice a year on average), annual review meetings and technical meetings.
DG EMPL and DG REGIO regularly monitored the financial implementation of the programmes by the Member States, including through a monthly budgetary execution report covering all Member States and OPs. The monitoring took place at EU level, Member State and programme level. Towards the end of the 2007-2013 programme period, the Commission enhanced its monitoring by regularly following up the implementation of the DGâ€™s internal Annual Management Plan.
Some Member States took action to address absorption difficulties at a relatively early stage, but the problem persisted
Some of the Member States visited had detected difficulties in implementing the Structural Funds relatively early in the programme period and established action plans or took measures to address them. For example, in Italy, Romania and the Czech Republic action plans had been established as early as 2011. At the end of 2014, with one year left to use the available funding, the absorption rate for the ERDF, ESF and CF stood at around 77Â % for the EU-28. In the case of Italy, Romania, the Czech Republic, along with Slovakia and Bulgaria, the absorption rate was well below this level i.e. between 61Â % and 68Â %, whereas in the case of Croatia, the absorption rate was around 46Â %.
Although the TFBI was set up late, its results were significant 
In November 2014, 11 months after the end of the programme period, the Commission set up the Task Force for Better Implementation (TFBI). This was designed to support Member States facing difficulties in implementing their OPs in using the remaining funding from the 2007-2013 period.
The TFBI, represented by officials from DG REGIO, covered Member States whose overall absorption rate was below the EU average (Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Croatia). It also covered Hungary, which was at risk of losing funding in 2014 as a result of automatic de-commitment even though its absorption level was close to the EU average. In total, the TFBI concentrated on 38 ERDF and CF OPs. Box 3 provides an outline of the work of the TFBI. 
Box 3 â€“ The Task Force for Better Implementation
The TFBI was responsible for drawing up action plans (or reviewing existing plans if already in place) with each Member State concerned with the aim of improving implementation. To this end it identified measures allowed by the legislative framework that could help increase absorption (see paragraph 41 to 78 for a detailed overview of the most significant measures used by the Member States). It organised technical meetings with national authorities to follow-up on the implementation of the action plans, as well as seminars on particular topics (such as closure, major projects and others) with a view to enable exchange of good practices and improve administrative capacities.
Our examination of technical documents provided by the TFBI to Member States, confirmed that they addressed absorption and risks relating to legality and regularity. However, the documents did not consider how to spend funds well or how to create better outputs and good results.
The TFBI had monitored the Member Statesâ€™ progress on the agreed measures. However, the manner in which the Member States reported on their results made it difficult to have an overview of all the measures that were used and the impact of each measure on absorption. 
However, within the span of one year the absorption rate for the EU-28 increased from around 77Â % (December 2014) to almost 90Â % (December 2015). The absorption rate for the Member States assisted by the TFBI increased significantly, in some cases by more than 20 percentage points (see Table 1). 
Table 1 â€“ Increase in the absorption rate for Member States assisted by the TFBI
Note: Slovenia and Croatia are not included in the table as their situation was not comparable to that of the other Member States (see footnotes 37 and 40).
The Member States visited said that they had found the TFBI useful because of the technical guidance and assistance it had provided, in particular on the phasing of major projects (see paragraphs 60 to 62). They also said that it had created a formal forum for addressing implementation problems and had facilitated knowledge-sharing. The Czech Republic and Hungary felt that the TFBI was established too late, as these two Member States had already started taking action to increase absorption. 
The work of the TFBI finished at the end of 2015. The Commission found the working approach and method of the TFBI effective, and as a result extended them by setting up a permanent unit, the Better Implementation Unit, to help with implementation during the 2014-2020 programme period.
Various measures accelerated absorption but lacked focus on results 
We looked at the main measures applied by the Member States and their effect on increasing absorption as well as their impact on performance and compliance with the eligibility rules.
The EU funding placed at the Member Statesâ€™ disposal should be used in full and in the best possible manner with a view to achieving the OP objectives. To this end, Member States should use the measures allowed by the Regulation with due regard to value for money and regularity of expenditure. 
Reprogramming was an effective tool for optimising absorption but resulted in significant changes to the initial plans, presenting risks to value for money
Revising (or reprogramming) OPs is an important tool for optimising absorption and avoiding de-commitment i.e. not using the funds. In addition, it provides flexibility to Member States to adapt to changing circumstances on the ground. It was used frequently during the 2007-2013 programme period and resulted in significant changes when compared with the initial financing plan. However, we also noted some risks to value for money associated with the use of reprogramming (see paragraphs 53 and 55).
Reprogramming methods include transferring funds between OPs and between priorities (including introducing new priorities or the eliminating existing ones), changing co-financing rates, or changing the public and private component of the national contribution.
The following sections (paragraphs 46 to 59) discuss the change made to the regulatory framework to ease reprogramming, analyse the impact of reprogramming on initial planning and illustrate the use of each of these reprogramming methods from our sample of 20 OPs.
An amendment to the Regulation made it easier to revise OPs
OPs can be revised at the initiative of Member States or of the Commission in agreement with the Member State. The conditions for such revisions as stipulated in Article 33 of the General Regulation, are very broad in scope and provide the Member States with considerable room for manoeuvre. An OP can be revised in the event of: significant socio-economic changes, major changes in EU, national or regional priorities or of an evaluation showing a significant departure from goals initially set, or as a result of implementation difficulties. The Commission must approve or reject the revision of the OP within three months of a Member State formally submitting it. Member States were initially required to carry out an evaluation when revising an OP. This was relaxed in 2010 with the Member States being required to provide an analysis justifying the revision of the OP and its expected impact. This amendment to the General Regulation was meant to facilitate the adaptation of the OPs. 
Frequent revisions of OPs calls programming into question
During the 2007-2013 programme period, reprogramming was used frequently by the Member States. Nineteen out of our sample of 20 OPs were reprogrammed multiple times during the period, sometimes more than once in the same year. Furthermore, we found that for eight of the 20 OPs examined, the interval between two instances of reprogramming was less than five months. For example, one Czech ERDF OP â€œEnterprises and Innovationsâ€ had eight different versions, of which two were submitted in 2013 and another two in 2015. Figure 7 gives an overview of the number of versions submitted for each OP for the 2007-2013 programme period.

Reprogramming enables Member States to realign their operations to take account of changes in circumstances on the ground and changes in EU policies. Nonetheless, the high frequency of reprogramming calls into question the soundness of the analyses underlying the programming process (e.g. the initial needs analysis and ex-ante-evaluation) and subsequent revisions.
Reprogramming resulted in significant changes in the financial allocation to priority axes which was not always reflected in the target values of the performance indicators
A frequent type of reprogramming of OPs is to transfer a financial allocation between OPs or priority axes within OPs. This allows Member States to transfer funding towards measures where demand for funding is greater or implementation is easier. In general, a material change in the financial allocation requires a corresponding revision in the performance indicators and the target values to be able to determine whether the funding invested obtained good value for money.
Nine out of the 20 OPs in our sample transferred funds to or received funds from other OPs. For most OPs (eight out of the nine), the transfer was less than 10Â % of the initial EU contribution to the OP. However, for one Slovak OP â€œCompetitiveness and Economic Growthâ€, the EU contribution to the OP increased by 25.4Â %. 
Member States also transferred funding between priority axes, which in some cases resulted in significant changes from the initially programmed amounts (see Box 4). 
Box 4 - Significant transfers of EU contributions between priority axes
For a Czech ERDF OP â€œEnterprise and Innovationâ€ funding for Priority 3.2 â€œDevelopment of Companiesâ€ was increased by 52.2Â % (from 663 million to over 1 billion euros) and for Priority 3.4 â€œInnovationâ€ by 35.8Â % (from 680.1 million to 923.7 million euros) to accelerate absorption.
For Italian ERDF OP â€œSicilyâ€ funding for Priority 6 â€œSustainable Urban Developmentâ€ increased by 17.5Â % (from 539.5 to 634 million euros) to help speed up absorption.
In one Hungarian OP changes in the financial allocation did not result in a change in the target value of the performance indicator (see Box 5).
Box 5 â€“ Significant transfers of EU contribution between priority axes without proportional adjustment of target value of the performance indicator
The Hungarian ERDF OP for Environment and Energy was revised four times. In 2012, a transfer was made from another OP, whereas in 2013, 2015 and 2016, transfers between priority axes were made. Funds were reallocated to priorities with projects which could be implemented faster. As a result the EU contribution to Priority 5 â€œEfficient Energy Useâ€ was increased by 390Â %Â (from 131.2 to 642.6 million euros). At the same time, the target value for the indicator â€˜energy resources saved through energy efficiencyâ€™ was reduced in 2012 to less than a third from 11 to 2.7Â petajoules per year, but was not reviewed when additional funding was allocated to the priority axis.
The examples above illustrate that the focus on absorption and spending the money fast pose a risk to achieving better results when disbursing EU funds. 
Increasing the EU co-financing rate boosts absorption but reduces the value that can be obtained from EU funds
Increasing the EU co-financing rate helps Member States speed up the absorption rate and reduces the amount of funds at risk of de-commitment. In this way, a Member State can be reimbursed at the revised rate for all previously declared expenditure. Increasing the co-financing rate allows the immediate and quick absorption of funds with retroactive effect.
An increase in the co-financing rate eases pressure on the national budget as the Member Stateâ€™s initial planned contribution to the OP is reduced, however it reduces the overall value of the OP. This means that the scale (number or size) of the interventions is also reduced, unless Member States continue to invest the funding originally planned at national level. As a result this may have a negative impact on objectives and results that can be achieved by the OPs which in turn affects the value that can be achieved by the disbursed EU funds. 
More than half of the OPs in our sample (11 OPs out of 20) were programmed from the start at the maximum EU co-financing rate laid down in the Regulation. For eight OPs, the co-financing rate was increased during the period. Table 2 shows the increase in the EU co-financing rate and the decrease in the national contribution. For these eight OPs the total reduced national contribution amounts to 4.8 billion euros.
Table 2 â€“ Decrease in national contribution as a result of increase in the co-financing rate
Note: The regulatory maximum EU co-financing rate is 85Â % for Bulgaria and Romania, 80Â % for Spain and 75Â % for Italy.

Member States introduced private contributions to increase their rates of absorption, but this also resulted in reduced interventions
The Member Statesâ€™ share of national co-financing may either be provided through a national public contribution only or may also contain a private contribution. Where the programme contains a private contribution, the OP financing plan takes into account the funding provided by private sector grant recipients.
An increase in private contributions can help absorb funding quicker as they complement national public expenditure to be reimbursed as part of EU co-financing and/or replace the national public contribution needed to match the EU co-financing. The effect is immediate and has a one-off positive impact on absorption of EU funds by increasing the amount of eligible expenditure available for reimbursement. However, since part of the private contribution is expenditure that would have been incurred irrespective of the public contribution, the replacement of the public contribution with the private reduces overall the Member Statesâ€™ investment. As indicated above (see paragraph 55) this reduces the scale of intervention to achieve the Cohesion policy objectives.
At the start of the programme period none of the 20 OPs in our sample included a private component in their OP financing plan. By the end of the programme period five OPs introduced a private contribution, thereby reducing the national public contribution at the same time. Table 3 shows the private contribution introduced and the theoretical EU contribution that this could release.

Note: The theoretical EU contribution generated by including private expenditure is calculated by applying the EU co-financing rate to the private contribution. The final contribution generated by private expenditure will be known only at the time of closure.

Phasing of projects reduces the risk of de-commitment if projects are not entirely completed at closure
The 2007-2013 regulatory framework provided for the implementation of a major project over two programme periods, i.e. dividing a project into two stages, between the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods. Although the General Regulation provided only for the phasing of major projects, the Commissionâ€™s closure guidelines went even further, extending the principle of phasing to non-major projects with a value of at least 5 million euros.
The benefit of phasing is that it reduces the risk that on-going major projects which are non-functional by 31 March 2017 (i.e. the date for submitting closure documents), or by 31 March 2019 at the very latest, are considered ineligible and the corresponding EU funding is not used. Nine out of 14 OPs in our sample opted to phase major projects or projects above 5 million euros. The use of phasing reduced the risk of EU co-financing for these projects of 4.5 billion euros (3.8 billion euros for major projects and 0.7 billion euros for non-major projects over 5 million euros) would not be used in the 2007-2013 programme period.
While phasing is beneficial to absorption and acknowledges that on-going project implementation does not stop at programme end, a recent audit revealed that phasing in Cohesion is more complicated and restrictive than in Rural Development policy, even though the policy areas are very similar.
Retrospective projects were used to absorb EU funding but represent a considerable risk of deadweight 
Retrospective projects or operations are those which have incurred expenditure or are completed before EU co-financing has been formally applied for or awarded, i.e. they are financed retrospectively. Retrospective projects are another means of absorbing funding by creating additional new expenditure or by substituting ineligible expenditure.
There are clear risks to value for money with retrospective projects as they are often selected, initiated or carried out without having been expressly linked to a programmeâ€™s objectives or to specific legal requirements linked to EU assistance. In its guidance on retrospective EU assistance the Commission discourages their use as they entail a high risk of non-compliance with the relevant Union and national rules.
In addition, as retrospective projects are already implemented with national funding, this raises doubt as to the added value of using EU funding to co-finance these projects. It also poses a risk of deadweight, since these projects would have been implemented even without the EU funding. 
Of the four Member States we visited, three (Italy, Hungary and Romania) stated that they used retrospective projects (see Box 6). 
Box 6 â€“ Use of retrospective projects and expenditure
The Managing Authority for the Italian OP â€œSiciliaâ€ indicated that in 2014 total eligible cost for retrospective projects amounted to 437.3 million euros. For 2015 it estimated that such expenditure would potentially amount to 250 million euros.
In the case of two Hungarian OPs â€œTransportâ€ and â€œEnvironment and Energyâ€ the national authorities indicated that the retrospective projects identified amounted to a total eligible cost of 195.1 million euros and 74.5 million euros, respectively. 
For the Romanian OP â€œHuman Resources and Developmentâ€ the national authorities indicated that seven retrospective projects were identified with a total eligible cost of 166.7 million euros. To finance these projects, a total of 110 million euros was transferred from certain priority axes towards the priority axis in which the retrospective projects could fit.
Member States are not obliged to report to the Commission on the expenditure declared retrospectively. As a result, the Commission is not aware of the volume and financial impact of expenditure declared retrospectively, despite the clear risks to such funding. Our work undertaken for the statement of assurance shows that many Member States use retrospective expenditure and that EU co-financing of retrospective projects is likely to be significant for the 2007-2013 period.
As part of our work for the 2015 Annual Report, we identified errors relating to expenditure on retrospective projects (see Box 7). In a previous report the Court has said that such projects are more error-prone than those selected in the normal way.
Box 7 â€“ Ineligible expenditure incurred by retrospective project
An Italian project to improve the sewage system in a municipality was approved and financed with national resources. The project expenditure amounting to 2.5 million euros was subsequently included under the OP â€œCampaniaâ€ as a project for retrospective co-financing.
During our audit, we identified a change in the scope of a public procurement contract resulting in a breach of the relevant provisions. Consequently, nearly 30Â % of the declared expenditure was considered ineligible and should have not been declared for co-financing. 
For the 2014-2020 programme period, the use of retrospective projects has been restricted somewhat. Operations (consisting of one or several projects) that have started to incur expenditure but have not been physically completed or fully implemented before the beneficiary submits the application for funding under the programme to the Managing Authority may be eligible for EU funding. However, the risk of ineligible expenditure as well as the question of the added value of the EU co-financing remain.
Even though the eligibility period was extended, 8Â % of endowments to financial instruments were not used and had no revolving effect 
During the 2007-2013 programme period Member States could absorb money temporarily by paying it into a financial instrument and receiving reimbursement from the Commission, thereby avoiding the risk of de-commitment during the implementation phase. In addition, to help improve absorption, the eligibility period for disbursements from financial instruments to final recipients was extended by the Commission from 31 December 2015 to 31 March 2017. This resulted in additional payments to final recipients of 1.6 billion euros. The Court has reported on this issue in previous reports.
An important advantage of using financial instruments is their revolving effect, i.e. the possibility that endowments to financial instruments can be used more than once. Therefore it is important that full endowments to financial instruments are used during the programme period to enable the revolving effect to materialise.
We have previously reported that low disbursement rates in particular in the first years of the 2007-2013 programme period limited the revolving effect. In October 2017, the Commission has reported on the financial implementation as at 31 March 2017 (at closure) for financial instruments. A desk review of the figures in this report revealed a number of inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Member Statesâ€™ reporting. As the closure process is still on-going, the Commission should be in a position to verify the reliability of the figures used to close the OPs.
Nonetheless, on the basis of the data reported by Member States to the Commission at closure, we estimate that approx. 8% (i.e. 0.9 billion out of 11.3 billion euros) of endowments to financial instruments had not been used by the deadline of 31 March 2017 and must be returned to the OPs. These funds could be transferred from the priority axis of the under-performing financial instruments to another priority axis provided that sufficient excess expenditure is available in line with the 10% flexibility rule set out in the closure guidelines. For those OPs where these conditions are not met, the funds returned to the OP (or part of those) must be paid back to the EU budget. For the funds returned to the OPs, no revolving effect had occurred and, but the management fees incurred thereupon even though in accordance with the financial agreements, did not provide any added value to the EU Budget.
Contractual advances made towards the end of the eligibility period may pose risks to value for money and compliance
Contractual advance payments are a common market practice, enabling the contractor to cover initial expenditure for mobilising the resources necessary for delivering the services or works contracted. According to the Commission, such advances are typically in the range of 10Â % to 40Â % of the contract value. 
A contractual advance payment is eligible if it was paid to the contractor by 31 December 2015 and converted into actual expenditure before 31 March 2017. It should also be compliant with national rules and contractual obligations. However for projects approved towards the end of the eligibility period (i.e. 31 December 2015) the need to finalize the projects by the closure deadline (i.e. 31 March 2017) may result in allocation of funds to projects based on their capacity to spend quickly rather than on their ability to provide results.
Of the four Member States we visited, two (the Czech Republic and Hungary) used contractual advances to increase absorption. For example, the Czech Managing Authority indicated that as of September 2016, for OP â€œEnvironmentâ€, total advance invoices amounted to 133 million euros in EU contributions. This represented around 5Â % of total absorption in 2014 and 2015 (see BoxÂ 8). 
Box 8 â€“ advances amounting to a high percentage of contract value
For the Czech OP â€œEnvironmentâ€ contractual advances were used to avoid de-commitment and improve absorption. Between November 2013 and March 2016, the national rules were gradually relaxed, and beneficiaries were encouraged to use advance and supported in doing so. In 2014 and 2015 contractual advances up to 90Â % of the contractual value were permitted without supporting clearing invoices. After November 2015, advances of 100Â % of the contract value were permitted although the National Authorities indicated that no certification was possible without proof of settlement of invoices. This goes beyond what the Commission identified as market practice (see paragraph 74). In terms of absorption, the high percentage of contract value increase the risk that the advance will not have been used by the deadline, possibly resulting in EU funding being either lost or incorrectly paid out.
We have previously reported that the declaration of contractual advances, especially where these represent a high percentage of the contractual value, introduces a risk of ineligible expenditure at the time of closure. Since advances could be turned into actual expenditure until 31 March 2017, the closer the actual expenditure is to the deadline the less the time available for audit authorities to verify it and provide assurance to its eligibility.
Member States were obliged to monitor contractual advances however they were not required to report to the Commission on this. As a result the Commission is not in a position to know their overall use and impact. At the time of the audit we found that Hungary did not monitor the use or impact.
Overall the error rate fell since 2007 for Cohesion even though retrospective projects led to some errors
We looked at the developments in the Cohesion control framework during the 2007-2013 programme period and how this impacted on the error rate. We also looked at whether the focus on absorption particularly towards the end of the programme period resulted in more errors. 
Our examination of the error rates reported by the Court since 2007 shows a significant reduction in the error rate for 2007-2013 expenditure compared to the previous programme period. The error rate was consistently lower from 2011 to 2016 resulting in a most likely error rate of 4.8Â % in 2016 (lower error limit of 3.1Â % compared to 11Â % in 2007 and 2008 for payments from the 2000-2006 period). 
The development in the error rate can be attributed to a number of factors. As indicated above, some measures to improve absorption such as the use of retrospective projects (see Box 7) resulted in some errors. On the other hand, other significant factors such as overall improvements in the Member Statesâ€™ management, control and supervisory systems and the Commissionâ€™s use of preventive (interruptions and suspensions) and corrective measures for the 2007-2013 programme period have led to a reduction in the error rate.
Conclusions and recommendations
For Cohesion policy the maximum level of expenditure under the MFF is broken into yearly allocations of funds per Member State. Such allocations facilitate the programming process and allow for the ex-ante setting of targets within OPs. However, the Court noted, that it is a challenge to obtain good results from schemes where funds are pre-allocated to Member States and the absorption of funds receives primary focus, thus becoming an objective in itself. To maintain a focus on achieving good results, it is crucial that Member States avoid a situation where a significant amount of funds remain to be absorbed at the end of the programme period, since the rush to absorb funds may lead to insufficient consideration to value for money. Thus, while absorption is important in order to achieve policy objectives, it is not an end in itself.
For the last two programme periods the late adoption of the legislative framework meant late adoption of the OPs. This had an inevitable knock-on effect on the implementation of the allocated funds and low level of payments in the first years. The Commission has encouraged an early political agreement on the post-2020 MFF in order to provide legal and financial certainty to the national and regional authorities and enable implementation to start immediately at the start of the programme period (see paragraphs 16 to 19).
Beside the knock-on effect mentioned above, an additional explanation for the slow start in spending is that, half way through the programme period, Member States were still using funds from the previous programme period (see paragraph 22). This is why, in a previous special report, we recommended that the Commission should ensure, in its legislative proposals for the post-2020 period, that eligibility periods no longer overlap with the subsequent programme period and that the closure procedure is finalised promptly after the end of the eligibility period. 
To achieve a smooth and stable implementation throughout a programme period, actions to address slow absorption should be taken early. Some Member States and the Commission identified difficulties in absorbing funding relatively early in the 2007-2013 programme period. However, the Commission only took a comprehensive set of actions in November 2014, almost one year before the end of the eligibility period, by setting up a Task Force to assist Member States whose absorption rates were below the EU average (see paragraph 34 to 35).
The Member States used several measures, including those identified by the TFBI and in the span of one year managed to increase their absorption rate in some cases by more than 20 percentage points. At the start of 2018 the average EU absorption rate stood at 97.2Â %. Several Member States did not manage to use all the funding available and unused funding at the end of 2017 amounted to 4.4 billion euros. The final absorption rate and the final value of unused funding will be known once closure is complete (see paragraph 28). 
Our work showed that the actions taken by the Commission and Member States to tackle slow absorption focussed mainly on absorption and legality but did not take due account of performance considerations. For some of the measures used, from our sample we found that: 
OPs were revised frequently, resulting in significant changes from the initial plans and calling into question the soundness of the analyses underlying the programming and the ability to achieve the OP and Cohesion policy objectives (see paragraph 43 to 59). 
The Member States visited had identified retrospective expenditure amounting to approximately one billion euros. The value of these projects for all 2007-2013 OPs is likely to be significantly higher. These types of projects have a high risk of deadweight (could have been implemented without EU funding) and thus limited EU added value (see paragraph 63 to 69).
Advances, such as endowments in financial instruments, helped to boost absorption during the programme period but slow implementation reduced their revolving effect. Around one billion euros were not used by the end of the eligibility period. Thus these funds had no revolving effect and the management fees incurred thereupon, even though in accordance with the financial agreements, did not provide any added value to the EU budget (paragraph 70 to 73).
Contractual advances also helped improve absorption. However for projects approved towards the end of the eligibility period the need to finalize the projects by the closure deadline may result in allocation of funds to projects based on their capacity to spend quickly rather than on their ability to provide results. Moreover the closer the actual expenditure is to the eligibility deadline the less the time available for Audit Authorities to verify its eligibility (see paragraphs 74 to 78).
The TFBI had monitored the Member Statesâ€™ progress on the agreed measures to improve absorption. However, the manner in which the Member States reported on the results made it difficult to have an overview of all the measures that were used and the impact of each measure. For some of the measures (e.g. retrospective co-financed projects, use of contractual advances) the legislative framework does not require Member States to report to the Commission. These two factors hampered its ability to get a comprehensive overview of the measures used and their individual financial impact (see paragraph 37, 67 and 78). 
Although the pressure to spend money towards the end of the 2007-2013 period resulted in some errors, the estimated error rate for Cohesion was consistently lower from 2011 to 2016, compared to 2007 and 2008. This may be due to the net effect of multiple factors (see paragraphs 80 to 81). 
For the 2014-2020 programme period implementation of the OPs started more slowly compared to the previous programme period. This, together with the fact that implementation difficulties were also encountered in the 2007-2013 period it is likely that Member States will also encounter absorption difficulties in the current period (see paragraph 23 to 26).

Executive summary
High-speed rail is a comfortable, safe, flexible and environmentally sustainable mode of transport. It brings environmental performance and socio-economic benefits which can support the EUâ€™s transport and cohesion policy objectives. Since 2000, the EU has provided 23.7Â billion euro of co-funding to support high-speed rail infrastructure investments.
We carried out a performance audit on the long-term strategic planning of high-speed lines in the EU, on the cost-efficiency (assessing construction costs, delays, cost overruns and the use of high-speed lines which received EU co-funding), and on the sustainability and EU added value of EU co-funding. We carried out our audit in six Member States, analysing expenditure for more than 5Â 000 km of infrastructure on ten high-speed rail lines and four border crossings, covering around 50Â % of the high-speed rail lines in Europe. 
We found that the EUâ€™s current long-term plan is not supported by credible analysis, is unlikely to be achieved, and lacks a solid EU-wide strategic approach. Although the length of the national high-speed rail networks is growing, the Commissionâ€™s 2011 target of tripling the number of kilometres of high-speed rail lines by 2030 will not be reached: 9Â 000Â km of high-speed line are currently in use, and around 1Â 700Â km of line was under construction in 2017. On average, it takes around 16Â years for new high-speed lines to proceed from the start of works to the beginning of operations.
There is no European high-speed rail network, and the Commission has no legal tools and no powers in the decision making to ensure that Member States make rapid progress towards completing the core network corridors set out in the TEN-T Regulation. As a result, there is only a patchwork of national high-speed lines, planned and built by the Member States in isolation. This patchwork system has been constructed without proper coordination across borders: high-speed lines crossing national borders are not amongst the national priorities for construction, even though international agreements have been signed and provisions have been included in the TEN-T Regulation requiring core network corridors to be built by 2030. This means a low EU added value of the EU co-funding of high-speed rail infrastructure investments. 
The quality of the assessment of real needs in the Member States is low, and the alternative solution of upgrading existing conventional lines is not often given due consideration, even though the savings achieved when this option is used can be significant. The decision to build high-speed lines is often based on political considerations, and cost-benefit analyses are not used generally as a tool to support cost-efficient decision-making.
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive, and is becoming more so: on average, the lines we audited cost 25Â million euro per km (not taking into account the more expensive tunnelling projects). The costs involved could in fact have been far lower, with little or no impact on operations. This is because very high-speed lines are not needed everywhere they have been built. In many cases, trains run on very high-speed lines at far lower average speeds than the line is designed to handle. The cost of a line increases proportionally with the design speed, and infrastructure capable of handling very high-speed operations (300Â km/h or more) is particularly costly. Such high- speeds, however, are never reached in practice: trains run on average at only around 45Â % of the lineâ€™s design speed on the lines audited, and only two lines were operating at an average speed above 200Â km/h, and none above 250Â km/h. Average speed so far below the design speed raises questions as to sound financial management.
We also analysed the cost per minute saved by the introduction of high-speed rail. We found that four of the ten lines we audited will cost more than one hundred million euro per minute saved. The highest figure is on the Stuttgart â€“ Munich line, which will cost 369Â million euro per minute saved. Cost overruns, which are covered by national budgets, and delays were the norm instead of the exception. Aggregate cost overruns for the lines and projects we audited were 5.7 billion euro at project level, and 25.1 billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). Delays at project and line level were also significant: eight of the 30 projects we audited had been delayed by at least one year, and five lines (half of the sample audited) had experienced delays of more than one decade. Paying careful attention to the elements above could save hundreds of millions of euros, and ensure that good use is made of lines which are built.
To gain insight into how high-speed rail benefits EU citizens, we also analysed and compared door-to-door travel times, prices and number of connections for high-speed rail and its competitors (air transport, conventional rail and road transport). We concluded that total travel time and price level are both important factors for success. Combined with effectively regular services, these factors could allow high-speed rail to increase its market share. Intermodal competition is fierce, and it affects the sustainability of high-speed lines: high-speed rail does not compete on an equal basis with other transport modes. 
We assess sustainability of the EU co-funding to be at risk. Judging by a benchmark, a high-speed line should ideally have nine million passengers per year to be successful. However, on three of the seven completed high-speed lines we audited, the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6 billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7 billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines. Our assessment of the number of people living in the catchment areas of the audited lines indicates that nine of the 14 audited lines and cross-border connections did not have enough potential passengers to be successful. These include the three lines indicated above carrying a lower number of passengers compared to the benchmark of nine million. 
In 2010, we issued a report calling for urgent action to lift all technical, administrative and other barriers to rail interoperability. However, we found that these barriers still persist in 2018. The rail passenger market is not open in France and Spain. There is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria; in these Member States, services were more frequent and of higher quality, whereas ticket prices were lower. Integrated ticketing systems, and greater attention paid to monitoring and standardising customer satisfaction and punctuality data, could further improve the passenger experience.
For a successful continuation of EU co-funding for high-speed rail infrastructure in the next programming period, we recommend that the Commission should take a number of steps. These include:
carrying out realistic long-term planning; and agreeing with the Member States the key strategic stretches to be implemented first, with close monitoring and enforceable powers to ensure that commitments to complete the core EU high-speed rail network are respected; 
making EU co-funding support linked to earmarked strategic priority projects, effective on-track competition and achievement of results;
simplifying cross-border constructions with regard to tendering procedures, the use of â€œone-stop-shopsâ€ for the formalities, and the lifting of all remaining barriers; 
actions to improve seamless high-speed rail operations for passengers, such as, for example, e-ticketing, simplification of track access charges and improving the reporting to citizens on punctuality and customer satisfaction data.



Introduction
High-speed rail in Europe
High-speed rail in Europe took off after the 1974Â petrol crisis. Europeâ€™s energy dependency threatened internal mobility, so several Member States decided to develop a safe, fast, comfortable and ecological mode of transport in the form of high-speed rail lines. Italy was the first European country to inaugurate a high-speed rail line: the line from Florence and Rome opened in 1977. Shortly afterwards, France inaugurated its own â€œTrains Ã  Grande Vitesseâ€ lines. Germanyâ€™s first high-speed lines, served by â€œIntercity Expressâ€ (ICE) trains, opened in the early 1990s, whereas Spainâ€™s â€œAlta Velocidad EspaÃ±olaâ€ (AVE) high-speed service commenced operations in 1992.
There is currently no single European high-speed rail network: instead, different operational models exist in different Member States (FigureÂ 1). For example, there are mixed high-speed systems (in France, Spain and Italy) and fully mixed high-speed lines (Germany, Austria and two sections in Italy).
FigureÂ 1 - Operational models for high-speed rail traffic

The EUâ€™s high-speed rail network is growing in size and in rate of utilisation
At the end of 2017, the EU had 9Â 067 km of high-speed lines (FigureÂ 2; AnnexÂ I provides a detailed map). This network is expanding: 1Â 671Â km are currently under construction. Once all planned high-speed rail infrastructure investments have been completed, Spain will have the second-longest high-speed rail network in the world, after China.

The number of passengers using high-speed rail in Europe is growing steadily: from roughly 15Â billion passenger-kilometres (pkm) in 1990, demand reached more than 124Â billion pkm in 2016. In 2015, high-speed rail services accounted for more than a quarter (26Â %) of all rail passenger travel in the Member States where high-speed services are available. 
EU policies for high-speed rail
Transport policy
The Trans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) programme plays a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It serves the goals of economic development, regional competitiveness, regional and social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. It also establishes key links needed to facilitate transport, optimising the capacity of existing infrastructure, producing specifications for network interoperability, and integrating environmental concerns. TEN-Tâ€™s objectives include the interconnection and interoperability of national transport networks, the optimal integration and interconnection of all transport modes, and the efficient use of infrastructure.
The latest Commission 2011 Transport White Paper (WP) has set the following specific passenger traffic targets for high-speed rail: (i) By 2030, the length of the existing high-speed rail network should be tripled so that, by 2050, most medium-distance passenger transport should be by rail (a 50Â % shift of medium-distance intercity passenger and freight journeys from road to rail). High-speed rail should grow faster than air transport for journeys of up to 1Â 000Â km, and by 2050, all core network airports should be connected to the rail network, preferably by high-speed services.
To advance on these goals, in December 2013, the EU adopted a new transport infrastructure policy that aims to close the gaps between the transport networks of Member States, to remove bottlenecks that still hamper the smooth functioning of the internal market, and to overcome technical barriers (e.g. incompatible standards for railway traffic). The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) instrument, adopted at the same time, supports these objectives financially.
Cohesion policy
Since 2000, the Structural Funds have been required to operate in a manner consistent with other EU policies, such as transport. Under both the ERDF and the CF Regulations, support has been provided to investments contributing to the establishment and development of TEN-T networks, as well as to transport infrastructure projects of common interest. 
Under the current 2014-2020 cohesion-policy framework, the EU cohesion-policy funds still support transport infrastructure but, to increase the effectiveness of EU co-funding, â€œex-ante conditionalitiesâ€ have been introduced. This means that Member States must demonstrate that proposed projects will be implemented within the framework of a comprehensive national, or regional, long-term transport plan, adopted by all interested and involved stakeholders.
EU support for building high-speed lines: significant, but a fraction of total cost
From 2000 to 2017, the EU provided 23.7Â billion euro in grants to co-finance high-speed rail infrastructure investments, as well as 4.4Â billion euro in support to install ERTMS on high-speed rail lines. Some 14.6Â billion euro of co-funding, or 62Â % of the total, was provided under shared-management funding mechanisms (the ERDF and the CF), while the directly managed investment schemes (e.g. the CEF) provided 9.1Â billion euro, or 38Â %. EU co-funding can be used to support studies as well as infrastructure works, both for new high-speed lines and for upgrades to existing conventional rail lines to allow them to accommodate high-speed operations.
In addition to this aid, since 2000, the EIB has also provided loans to the value of 29.7Â billion euro to support the construction of high-speed rail lines.
Almost half of the EU funding made available for high-speed rail investments (more than 11Â billion euro) was allocated to investments in Spain. In all, 21.8Â billion euro â€“ 92.7Â % of the total â€“ was allocated to seven Member States (FigureÂ 3 and AnnexÂ II).
FigureÂ 3 - Overview of EU co-funding for high-speed rail by Member State (2000-2017)

Although these sums are significant, EU co-funding represents a small fraction of the overall amounts invested in high-speed rail infrastructure works in the EU. For example, depending on the funding instruments used, the co-funding rate ranged from 2Â % in Italy to 26Â % in Spain. On average, EU co-funding covered around 11Â % of total construction cost.
Audit scope and approach
We carried out an audit on the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of EU co-funding for high-speed rail infrastructure investments since 2000. We assessed: (i) whether high-speed lines in the EU had been built according to a long-term strategic plan; (ii) whether high-speed rail projects had been implemented in a cost-efficient manner (by assessing construction costs, delays, cost overruns and use of high-speed lines which received investment support); (iii) whether the investments were sustainable after project completion (including the impact of high-speed rail on competing transport modes), and (iv) whether EU co-funding had added value. In order to answer these questions, this report analyses the planning and decision making first, continues with an assessment of costs, than takes an EU-citizen approach by analysing travel times, prices, connections and stations, and finalises with the assessment of barriers and on-track competition to conclude on high-speed rail operations.
We used a series of audit procedures, such as document reviews and analyses of EU and national long-term strategic development plans for high-speed rail; interviews with staff from the Commission and from Member States; meetings with rail operators and infrastructure managers; and a survey of key stakeholders. We engaged external experts to assess: (i) the quality of cost-benefit analyses (CBA) and future-demand analyses; (ii) the access, connections and regeneration effects of selected high-speed rail stations; (iii) the Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam (PBA) high-speed line, and (iv) the prices, travel times and number of connections using different modes of transport. We also benchmarked our audit results with high-speed rail operations and passenger services in Japan and Switzerland.
We carried out our audit at the European Commission (DG MOVE, including the INEA and the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), and DG REGIO) and in six Member States (France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal and Austria). These Member States received 83.5Â % of all EU funding allocated to high-speed lines since 2000 (23.7Â billion euros, corresponding to 46Â euros per EU resident).
Using a combination of specific sampling criteria related to the amount of EU co-funding, the length of the line, and whether or not a capital city was linked to the line, we selected ten high-speed lines for audit. On account of their size, we audited four high-speed lines in Spain and two each in Germany, Italy and France. We also assessed four cross-border projects: the connections between Munich and Verona; Spain and France (both on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean side), and Spain and Portugal (FigureÂ 4).
FigureÂ 4 - Overview of audited lines (10 high-speed lines, four cross-border connections)

Using high-speed lines as the basis for our audit allowed us to assess more than 5Â 000Â km of lines, either completed, under construction or in planning (for a detailed overview of the length of the lines audited, see TableÂ 4). This way, we covered more than 50Â % of the high-speed rail lines either in operation or under construction in the EU.
We also analysed 30Â EU co-funded projects on these high-speed lines (the largest projects under each management mode). The total proposed cost of the 30Â audited projects was 41.56Â billion euro. The amount of EU grants awarded to the audited projects was 6.18Â billion euro, of which 3.64Â billion euro had been paid by the time of the audit, and 967Â million euro decommitted (TableÂ 1).

Source: ECA. Cross-border projects are recorded under the â€œEUâ€ country code.
The project-related expenditure we audited covered 2Â 100Â km of different types of high-speed rail infrastructure (trackbeds, tunnels, viaducts and overpasses). Without taking into account the Munich-Verona cross-border section projects, our project audit covered 45Â % of the entire length of the high-speed lines in the visited Member States. A full list of all projects audited, and the key observations, and findings from our analysis of whether their outputs, results and objectives had been achieved, are presented in AnnexÂ III.
Observations
EU co-funded investments in high-speed rail can be beneficial, but there is no solid EU-wide strategic approach
High-speed rail is a beneficial mode of transport which contributes to the EUâ€™s sustainable-mobility objectives
Investment in high-speed rail infrastructure and operations significantly benefits society as a whole, as it brings to passengers time savings, high levels of safety, security and comfort on-board. It frees up capacity on congested road and conventional rail networks, as well as airports. High-speed rail can also strengthen socio-economic dynamism, as well as contributing to the regeneration of depressed urban areas near stations. 
Although the relationship is not entirely straightforward, various bodies have concluded that high-speed rail also brings environmental benefits as trains have a lower carbon footprint than most other modes of transport.
The Commissionâ€™s powers are limited, and its plan to triple the length of the high-speed rail network is unlikely to be achieved
The Commissionâ€™s current long-term plan, set out in the 2011 White Paper and the CEF Regulation (Recital No 11), to triple the length of high-speed rail lines in the EU by 2030 (from 9Â 700Â km in 2008 to 30Â 750Â km by 2030) is not supported by credible analysis. Given the state of indebtedness of national public finances (Member State governments are the main investors), the limited return on this public investment, and the time it takes in practice to complete a high-speed rail investment, the goal of tripling the high-speed rail network is very unlikely to be achieved.
Our audit work suggests that the average time from the start of works to the beginning of operations is around 16Â years (TableÂ 2), even without taking into account the time needed for upfront planning. This is true even when projects which require lengthy major tunnelling works, such as the Brenner Base Tunnel on the Munich-Verona stretch, are excluded.

The TEN-T Regulation sets out the key infrastructure that Europe needs to build to support the EUâ€™s sustainable mobility goals. It describes which transport investments are to be ready by 2030 (the core network), and which ones are to be ready by 2050 (the comprehensive network). To complete the core network, the Commission has estimated that 500Â billion euro will be required, while 1.5Â trillion euro is needed for the comprehensive network.
The Commission has no say in decision-making, and it has no legal tools and no powers to hold Member States to their earlier commitments to build the high-speed lines needed to complete the core network. It also plays no role in decisions on cross-border links between two or more Member States, as the CEF and TEN-T Regulations lack a possibility for the Commission to enforce set EU priorities.
Member States plan and decide on their national networks, leading to a patchwork of poorly connected national high-speed networks
EU trans-national corridors are not a priority
Although the TEN-T Regulation defines in its annexes where the high-speed lines are to be built, the Member States alone decide if and when exactly this will happen. They also provide most of the required funding, and they alone are responsible for implementing all of the necessary steps (studies, permits, procuring and monitoring works, and supervising all parties involved). AnnexÂ IV provides key performance indicators for selected visited Member States, which highlight the different characteristics of their national networks. These indicators point that France is in the lead when it comes to use of high-speed lines (ratios of passenger km per capita and passenger kilometres per km of high speed lines); that Spain has the highest construction cost per capita (1Â 159 euro) and the highest EU co-funding for high-speed rail per capita (305 euro); and that Italy has the highest construction costs per km per capita (0.46 euro).
Within a Member State, many entities have a role to play, and various factors and parameters are crucial to whether or not construction proceed as initially planned. For example: 
the â€œEurocaprailâ€ project aimed to link Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg by high-speed rail, connecting Luxembourg with Brussels in 90Â minutes. At its December 1994 meeting in Essen, the Council deemed this project to be one of the 30Â â€œtop prioritiesâ€ for building (works to start not later than 2010, and completion by 2020). By 2004, however, this project was no longer considered a national priority by any single Member State. Even though the EU has provided 96.5Â million euro to upgrade the conventional line, journeys from Brussels to Luxembourg currently take up to 3Â hours and 17Â minutes. This is more than twice the objective set in 2003, and almost one hour slower than in 1980, when the same distance was covered in 2Â hours and 26Â minutes. As a result, many potential passengers simply travel by road;
Spain has invested in a new high-speed rail network. To support it in doing so, the EU has invested more than 14 billion euro in Spanish high-speed lines already since 1994. Trains in Spain traditionally used a wider gauge than the rest of Europe, but for the most part, the Spanish high-speed network uses the standard gauge found in the rest of the EU. However, three of the audited lines (the Eje AtlÃ¡ntico; part of the Madrid â€“ Galicia high-speed line; and the Madrid â€“ Extremadura high-speed line), still use the traditional wider gauge. This impacts performance: the maximum operating speed is limited to 250 km/h (far below the maximum operating speed of 300 km/h for high-speed operations in Spain), and the services are provided either by wide-gauge rolling stock, or by specific variable-gauge trains. These trains need â€œgauge changersâ€: there were 20 such gauge changers in Spain in January 2017. These gauge changers cost up to eight million euro each, and the EU provided 5.4Â million euro in co-financing to support their construction.
Although international agreements have been signed to confirm the political will to establish connections, and although an incentive of 40Â % co-funding is available under the CEF Regulation, Member States do not build high-speed lines if they are not considered a national priority, even if such a line is situated on a transnational corridor and is completing the core network. The Commissionâ€™s mid-term evaluation report on the CEF confirmed this observation.
This limits the EU added value of the EU co-funding provided as cross-border links generate the highest EU added value. In addition, when links are missing and not built on time, this may have a high cost for society.
The Commission has no power to enforce cross-border projects
Major cross-border high-speed rail projects require particular attention from the EU. They require works to be coordinated closely, so that project outputs become ready for use on a similar schedule and are connected to domestic networks on both sides of the border.
The Commission currently lacks the necessary instruments to intervene effectively if delays on one side of a border hamper the timely use of high-speed rail infrastructure built on the other side of the border. Moreover, the possibilities for all stakeholders to oppose works are manifold, and may cause delays, or even to stop projects previously agreed upon.
There were several examples noted where the outputs created in one Member State will not be effective for at least another two further decades, because of works not having been completed in a neighbouring Member State (see BoxÂ 1).
BoxÂ 1 â€“ Poorly connected national networks, and their impact
Munich-Verona stretch, and the Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT): diverging construction priorities and timescales between Austria, Italy and Germany led to a patchwork of different capacities and potential bottlenecks on the whole Scandinavian-Mediterranean corridor until at least 2040.
To reduce the number of trucks crossing the Alps each day, the EU has been already investing in the BBT, a part of the â€œMunich â€“ Veronaâ€ stretch, since 1986. Austria and Italy have been building the tunnel with 1.58Â billion euro of EU co-funding. 

Source: ECA and Eurostat.
The tunnel works in Austria and Italy will be completed by 2027, but there is little construction activity on the northern access route, which is mostly in Germany. The route has not even been designed yet, and will not be completed before 2035 (Austria), or even 2040 (Germany). Unlike Austria and Italy, Germany sees little interest in destinations such as Innsbruck or Verona, which do not play a key role for Germany for everyday working traffic. As a result, it has not made a priority of constructing the northern access route, even though the route supports the goal of establishing a core network by 2030. This means that it will take more than half a century before the investments are actually used, and that more than 1,5 billion euro is considered largely ineffective for more than two decades.
Portugal-Spain connection (Extremadura)
A high-speed rail connection was planned to connect Lisbon and Madrid. However, it was considered too expensive in times of high government debt. Despite 43Â million euro of EU co-funding already having been paid to Portugal for studies and preparatory works, no high-speed cross-border rail connection is available. The conventional rail line stops in Evora. At the time of the audit, the works on the Portuguese side had started, while the works on the high-speed line on the Spanish side stopped about sixÂ kilometres from the border, as indicated by the arrow in PictureÂ 1.

Even though the policy framework was particularly geared towards completing the core network by 2030, many policy weaknesses remain to be tackled. For example, when assessing the cross-border works for the Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT), we noted the following.
Procurement is a major issue for cross-border TEN-T projects: there are no guidelines on how to reduce inherent procedural risks; there is no single legal framework for cross-border projects; tendering documents, contracts and accounting systems differ, also in their language, for works on Austrian and Italian territory; the procedures for settling disputes are not the same.
There are no simplified procedures to facilitate and accelerate implementation (e.g. â€œone-stop shopsâ€, as already suggested by the Court in Special Report NoÂ 23/2016); there is no single body streamlining the formalities on both sides of the border (e.g. different environmental legislation may apply to rail construction; and the legal response to stakeholdersâ€™ claims may vary).
As most of these constructions are backed up by international agreements between the Member States concerned and the EU, and since the high-speed lines are on international corridors, the progress of works is supervised by EU co-ordinators at corridor level and examined in â€œcorridor forumsâ€. These coordinators have a privileged view of what is, or is not, working along a corridor (and they report regularly on the changes needed), but they also have no legal power.
In addition to lacking coordination of cross-border implementation, a number of other aspects are lacking: (i) there are no â€œsingle-corridor entitiesâ€ to monitor results and impacts on a long term basis for future high-speed rail investments; (ii) there is no time-barring to limit the quantity and duration of legal or administrative action, and no single entity for hearing appeals; and (iii) the assessment of progress of works on a corridor is based on common key performance indicators which are still output-based. As the Court already argued in its special report on maritime transport, the project monitoring of the INEA focuses on construction per se (outputs) and covers neither results nor the use of the lines. Results and impacts are therefore not assessed, and no single body has a view of whether the EU co-funded projects on the core network corridors have achieved any result-based objectives.
Decision-making lacks reliable cost-benefit analyses
â€œVery high-speedâ€ is not needed everywhere
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive: on average, the lines we audited cost 25Â million euro per km (not taking into account the more expensive tunnelling projects), with the overall costs for the BBT as high as 145 million euro per km. Costs are rising over time: the most recent constructions (Milan-Venice and Stuttgart-Munich) are indicating values above 40 million euro per km because of scarcity of land, the crossing of urban nodes, viaducts and extensive tunnelling. However, costs could be lower with little impact on rail operations.
High-speeds are clearly an important characteristic of high-speed rail: they are the factor which allows high-speed rail to compete with air travel and balances the ease of using a private vehicle for the last few miles of a journey. The performance of the high-speed rail system is, however, not only determined by the maximum theoretical speed which can be achieved on a line, but also by the real speed which travellers experience. We therefore analysed the â€œspeed yieldâ€ on the audited high-speed lines, focusing on total travel times and average speeds.
Investment in high-speed lines is only justified if high-speed yields can be achieved: the larger the population base (future demand) and the greater the travel time elasticity and speed yield, the greater the benefits of developing a high-speed line.
This analysis of the speed yields on the lines we audited (AnnexÂ V) indicated that, on average along the course of a line, trains run at only around 45Â % of the lineâ€™s design speed. Only two lines operate at average speeds of more than 200 km/h, and no lines operate at an average speed above 250 km/h. The lowest speed yield on a completed high-speed line is on the Madrid-LeÃ³n high-speed line (39Â % of design speed). The cross-border Figueres-Perpignan section also only operates at 36Â % of its design speed, because it accommodates mixed traffic. Average speed so far below the design speed indicates that an upgraded conventional line would have been enough to achieve the objectives set, at a much lower cost and raises questions as to sound financial management.
A case-by-case approach is therefore needed to decide whether a full very high-speed line is needed. This decision is important, as construction costs are higher when design speeds are higher. Lines with maximum speeds of up to 160Â km/h are at least 5Â % cheaper to build than lines with speeds above that limit. This is because the tracks on higher-speed lines need to be further apart. Up to 160 km/h, the standard spacing is four metres; above that speed, the required line spacing is at least 4.5Â metres. This means that tunnels need to be wider, which is more expensive. 
Also, the cost of a â€œmixedâ€ high-speed line (combined passenger and freight traffic) is higher than for a passenger-only high-speed line, as gradients and curve radiuses make corridor alignments less flexible, and usually these need more land. Maintenance costs for mixed lines will also be higher, as more intensive use is made of the infrastructure.
Mixed traffic lines are more expensive than passenger-only high-speed lines. A study indicated this difference to be up to 5Â %, and up to 13Â % if the passenger-only line is limited to a speed of 250Â km/h (FigureÂ 5).

Choosing the most appropriate option can save millions of euros. For example, on the Munich-Verona stretch, a high-speed line is being built on the audited section of the Brenner Base Tunnel. This is not justified by the speed data: there are currently 13Â stops on the conventional rail line between Munich and Verona with 41Â minutes of stopping time at stations (12.6Â % of total travel time). At present, the journey from Munich to Verona for passengers takes 5Â hours and 24Â minutes. Even if the travel time should come down to around 3.5Â hours once the Brenner high-speed line is completed, the average speed on this line will still be just 115Â km/h, still too low to provide a convincing argument for building a fully-fledged high-speed line.
Cost-efficiency checks are rare
High-speed rail infrastructure is more costly than conventional rail, both to build and to maintain. In given circumstances, however, very high-speed services, operating at 300 km/h or more, may provide limited additional travel time savings, compared to trains running on upgraded conventional lines. Therefore, the option of upgrading existing conventional lines to increase speeds, rather than building a very high-speed line, should also be considered, as it could result in significant cost savings. 
A good practice exists in Italy and Germany: projects for which a preparatory phase has already been launched or legal obligations have arisen are re-assessed before each new programming phase to verify that their features still address current needs. This project review process highlights how design choices lead to substantial savings with limited impact on performance. For example, the project review carried out for the Venice-Trieste section concluded that configuring the line differently could save 5.7Â billion euro but add just 10Â minutes to the trip, i.e. a saving of 570Â million euro for each additional minute of travel time (TableÂ 3).

This practice applied in Italy and Germany is not used in the other Member States we visited: only the proposed construction of a high-speed line is assessed, and no consideration is made of whether any section, or even the entire line, actually needs to be capable of supporting very high-speed services, or whether an upgrade of the conventional line would also satisfy the specific project objectives.
We also analysed cost-efficiency by assessing the relationship between the investment costs and the real time saved on the audited high-speed lines (TableÂ 4). Our analysis shows that the cost per minute saved is on average 90 million euro per minute of travel time saved, with values ranging from 34.5 million euro (on the Eje AtlÃ¡ntico high-speed line) to 369 million euro (on the Stuttgart-Munich high-speed line).

Cost-benefit analyses are not used as a tool for decision-making in the Member States
As high-speed lines are expensive investments, it is crucial to correctly analyse all major costs and benefits upfront before deciding whether or not to build. When used correctly, cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) make it possible to assess a projectâ€™s social return on investment and its social desirability and usefulness before any decision is taken. Net contributions to social welfare (e.g. through benefit-to-cost ratios exceedingÂ 1, i.e. where benefits exceed costs) under a broad variety of demand (e.g. high versus low traffic growth) and supply scenarios (e.g. high-speed line construction versus upgrade of conventional lines) are needed to support a positive decision.
The Court asked an external expert to make a comparative analysis of the various CBAs linked to the audited high-speed lines. The expert concluded that CBAs are generally used merely as a compulsory administrative step, rather than as a tool for better decision-making and stakeholder inclusion. We found the following examples noteworthy.
A CBA with a negative economic net present value was accepted for EU co-funding of project No 2007-FR-24070-P (concerning the East Section of the Rhin â€“ RhÃ´ne high-speed line) in France. For another French high-speed rail project (project No 2010-FR-92204-P, concerning the upgrade of the existing line between Mulhouse and the border to allow operations of high-speed trains and intercity express) no CBA had been performed, but the project did receive EU funding.
No CBAs had been carried out when the decision was made to build the Halle/Leipzigâ€“Erfurtâ€“Ebensfeld and Stuttgart-Wendlingen-Ulm sections in Germany. The decision to build them was political, and a CBA was only made at a later stage (ex post) to demonstrate socio-economic profitability.
Most studies in Spain, irrespective of the region and project characteristics, showed very similar results and a relatively low benefit-to-cost ratio (of around one). In reality, some projects have only a limited chance of viability from a social cost-benefit perspective (for example, the â€œVenta de BaÃ±os â€“ LeÃ³nâ€ high-speed rail section was non-viable from a socio-economic perspective across various sensitivity scenarios), but they are being built nevertheless.
Since 2007, no update has been made to the Brenner axis CBA. In the 2007 analysis, the cost-benefit factor was 1.9. In the meantime, the planning and construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel project has already been delayed by around eleven years: its completion was initially expected by 2016, but now it is not expected until 2027. Most recent data reveals that the projected cost for the tunnel will be around 9.3 billion euro (taking into account the inflation rate). Between the preliminary estimates of 2002 and the estimate of 2013, costs increased by 46Â % (from 5.9 billion euro to 8.6 billion euro), and freight traffic is now projected to decrease. These factors reduce the benefit-to-cost ratio very strongly, and makes the 2007 CBA data on passenger numbers and freight traffic unrealistic. This was not questioned by the INEA, which is managing this on behalf of the Commission. 
For the 2015 CEF calls for proposals, the INEA introduced a specific assessment of costs and benefits before agreeing to provide CEF support. We consider that this will help to improve the quality of decision-making upfront. However, the INEA (as well as the Managing Authorities in case of cohesion policy expenditure under shared management) is currently not assessing the cost per minute saved, or the cost of upgrading the existing conventional rail line as alternative to the proposed new high-speed line before agreeing to spend EU co-funding.
Cost overruns, construction delays and delayed entry into service: a norm instead of an exception
The EU budget does not suffer from cost overruns for high-speed rail investments, as the co-funded amount is capped at the initially agreed amount. Although cost overruns are borne by national budgets, we assessed the extent of cost overruns and delays, both at project and at line level. Based on the data available to us, we estimate that aggregate cost overrun at 5.7Â billion euro at project level, and 25.1Â billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). 
Three projects out of 30 assessed had significant cost overruns of more than 20Â % of the initial estimates and all audited high-speed lines had cost overruns of more than 25 % (TableÂ 5). The German lines had the highest cost overruns: the cost overrun of the Stuttgart-Munich line reached 622.1Â %. 
TableÂ 5 - Overview of costs per km and comparison with estimates

Delays at project level were also significant: eight of the 30 projects we audited had been delayed by at least one year, and half of the lines (five lines out of the ten audited) had experienced delays of more than one decade. The Milan-Venice line is forecast to have the longest delay compared to initial estimates (18Â years).
The highest project cost overrun was 83Â %, for the â€œStuttgartÂ 21â€ station (PictureÂ 2), which received 726.6Â million euro in grants from the EU. 
PictureÂ 2 - Construction works on the StuttgartÂ 21 station

For this project, because of unrealistic initial cost estimates for tunnelling in a densely populated city centre, and insufficient assessments of geological, environmental and local community cultural heritage aspects, construction costs have soared. The total construction costs of 4.5Â billion euro estimated in 2003 has been increased to 6.5Â billion euro in 2013 and to 8.2Â billion euro (latest estimate available in January 2018). This means that there is a difference of 3.7Â billion euro from the original agreement. So far, all funding partners have refused to cover more than the costs set in the original funding agreement. 
There will also be a significant delay in completing the works for this station, as it was originally planned that the construction works would be completed by 2008. The start was already delayed from 2001 to 2009, and current estimations are that the works will be completed by 2025. 
Finally, for 18 projects, we also assessed how long it took for the lines to actually enter into service once the EU co-funded works had been completed. For six projects, entry into operations happened not later than one month after the end of construction works. For two projects, entry into service had been delayed by around one year; for six projects, the delay was two years; for another, the delay was four years; while two projects in Germany will be delayed by eight years (these projects were finished by the end of 2015, and it is currently estimated that the line will not be in operation before the end of 2023). In one other case (the Figueres â€“ Perpignan cross-border line between Spain and France), even though the whole line was finished, it could not be used until 22Â months later since it was not connected to the rest of the network on both ends. 
A citizenâ€™s view: a real-life assessment of travel times, prices and connections, of passenger-services and of stations and their catchment area
Travel times and ticket prices, are important factors for success
We examined the competitiveness of high-speed rail by asking a travel agent to research the cheapest return ticket prices, travel times and number of connections on given days for both business and tourist profiles on the audited lines. A summary of our methodology and the relevant data are in AnnexÂ VI. This allowed us to calculate average prices per kilometre and minute of travel. 
Ticket prices may vary widely (e.g. according to the time of day, and the availability of special offers). However, this work was done on a sufficient scale (data on more than 5Â 000Â return trips was collected) to allow us to realistically assess the options for travelling between the origin and destination pairs on the audited lines. The following messages came out of this analysis.
On speed: High-speed rail is often much faster (on average 30Â % to 50Â % of travel time) than conventional rail. Air travel (from take-off to landing) is faster than high-speed rail. However, when assessing real total travel time from city centre to city centre, including the travel to the airport and boarding procedures, high-speed rail is often competitive.
On ticket prices: High-speed rail is often much cheaper than air travel. Last-minute bookings for both transport modes are more expensive than tickets booked in advance. In Germany, ticket prices on the Stuttgart-Munich high-speed line are lower than conventional rail ticket prices.
The number of high-speed rail services offered varies considerably during the year. The availability of connections is important: some high-speed lines have a large number of connections (e.g. 50-60 per day in Germany), while two of the four audited lines in Spain (Madrid-Santiago and Madrid-LeÃ³n) and the two audited French lines had very few connections. 
Some of the audited routes are not practicable by conventional rail; for example, travelling from Rome to Turin by conventional rail takes over 20Â hours. High-speed rail takes half as long, and air travel one-tenth as long. The situation is similar on the Madrid-Santiago line. 
The most successful connections in terms of business users (e.g. Madrid-Barcelona; Turin-Rome; Paris-Strasbourg) are also the most expensive. Overall, high-speed rail in France costs most per kilometre travelled (for business and leisure).
To assess how competitive high-speed rail really is, total travel time from city centre to city centre and the prices of the available options were analysed. We further refined our data analysis for four lines, and calculated the relevant figures, comparing high-speed rail, conventional rail, air and road, thus including the cost of private cars and long-distance coaches (TableÂ 6).
Table 6 - Door-to-door travel analysis on selected high-speed lines
Source: ECA.
The â€œcity centre to city centreâ€ analysis told us the following:
Between Madrid and Barcelona, the high-speed rail connection is the fastest travel option: even air travel takes longer from door to door, and is more expensive. This explains why high-speed rail has increased its market share considerably on this line in recent years. In fact, since its opening in 2008, the modal split between air and rail has changed from 85:15 to 38:62 in 2016. Such analysis can be used to assess the success of high-speed rail operations and measure the degree of sustainability of the investments made. 
Between Rome and Milan, air and high-speed rail also lead the field in terms of travelling time. The number of trains increased and ticket prices reduced over time. High-speed rail is therefore taking a larger market share over time, also at the expense of long-distance conventional rail.
It is possible to travel by conventional rail from Berlin to Munich, but it involves many changes. Air travel is fastest, but expensive. High-speed rail is the second-fastest option, and it is cheaper. While coach travel is cheapest, the journey time is dissuasive. 
From Paris to Strasbourg, there are no air or direct conventional rail connections. High-speed rail has the fastest total travel time, but ticket prices are much higher than travelling by car or coach. 
Our overall conclusion is that total travel time and price level are both important factors for success. Combined with an effectively regular service (frequent trains which depart and arrive on time), these factors could contribute to strengthen future high-speed rail operations.
Further improvements needed to rail ticketing, and in monitoring passenger-services data
Published research on high-speed rail suggests that ticketing flexibility and punctuality enhance intermodal competitiveness and promote sustainable success. These could be developed further.
Rail ticketing compares poorly with that of the airline industry. For example, single e-ticketing solutions, such as those allowing booking trips involving more than one operator or crossing borders, are much easier for air travel than for rail. There is also almost no search engine available for combined air/high-speed rail travel.
The Commission has started to collect service-related data and indicators on the developments in the use of rail networks, and on the evolution of framework conditions through its Rail Market Monitoring Scheme (RMMS) platform. However, this data has been inconsistent up to now, as common standards were not comprehensively applied until the end of 2017. Moreover, only a limited set of data is currently collected in respect of high-speed rail as opposed to conventional rail; it covers the areas of infrastructure charging, capacity allocation, infrastructure investment and public-service obligations covering high-speed rail.
Until 2017, there were no agreed common definitions of punctuality. Punctuality data therefore varies greatly within the EU. Rail operators are obliged to post the reports on punctuality and customer satisfaction on the ERADIS database as required by ArticleÂ 28(2) of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1371/2007 but, as there is no common methodology or standardised framework for these reports, they are hard to use and do not provide travellers with a clear overview of the situation. The Commission has commissioned Eurobarometer surveys to monitor passenger satisfaction with rail services. The last survey was published in 2013, and a follow-up report is expected by the end of June 2018. Significant progress is still needed in monitoring these issues at the EU level.
The number and location of stations are both important
Having the right number of stations is vital to a lineâ€™s success and to its operational sustainability. If a line has very few or no intermediate stops, the overall speed between origin and destination is high, and competitiveness with other modes of transport is optimal; however, this is detrimental to sustainability, as fewer potential passengers living along the line can use it. In contrast, if there are more stops on a line, its average speed is lower, and competitiveness with other modes of transport is at stake, but more passengers can board, increasing ticket income. 
We analysed the number of stops on the audited lines and the resulting impact on travel times and the competitiveness of services on the line, as well as their accessibility, connectivity and regeneration effects. The full information and all key data on this station analysis is in AnnexÂ VII.
Data from official timetables shows that each intermediate stop extends total travel time by an average of four to 12Â minutes, and reduces average speed by three to 16Â km/h. The number of stations ranges from four (LGV Rhin-RhÃ´ne) to 15 (on the Berlin-Munich line) and the distances between them vary greatly (the longest distance between two stations on the same high-speed line is 253Â km; the shortest is 26Â km). Different types of services run on the audited lines (for example, on the Madrid-Barcelona line, some trains run a â€œnon-stopâ€ service over 621Â km, whereas other trains on the line also serve intermediate stations, with varying frequency). The largest time difference between the most direct and least direct train services is 72Â minutes (on the Berlin-Munich line).
To assess the potential number of users of a high-speed line, we also examined the catchment areas of each of the ten high-speed lines and four cross-border lines in the audit. Some stations do not have sufficient numbers of passengers in their immediate catchment areas, and are located too close to each other. This reduces the overall effectiveness of high-speed services, because they must stop too often without reaching many new passengers, or it makes daily train management overly complicated to ensure acceptable ridership figures.
AnnexÂ VIII contains overall results and key data on the stations of all the audited high-speed lines. For example, as shown in FigureÂ 6, although the Madrid-Barcelona-French border line has a very large catchment area (which explains its success), the catchment area of some stations on the line (e.g. Guadalajara-Yebes or Calatayud) is extremely small. Given the very limited number of people living within the 15-minute catchment area, there is reason to doubt the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of keeping these stations as stops on the high-speed line (the 100Â % 60-minute catchment area overlap for Guadalajara station is because of its proximity to Madrid).

While the Commissionâ€™s plan is to connect all core network airports to the rail network by 2050, preferably by high-speed rail, only a few high-speed rail stations currently have a direct high-speed connection to an airport. High-speed rail and air can be complementary (by delivering passengers to an airport, high-speed rail can enlarge the airportâ€™s catchment area, and air passengers may decide to use a given airport because of a seamless and fast rail connection after landing). However, we found that it is complicated for passengers to combine high-speed rail and air travel. For example, even though the Madrid â€“ Barcelona high-speed line passes close to Spainâ€™s two busiest airports (Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat, which were used by 50.4Â million and 44.2Â million passengers respectively in 2016), there are no plans to connect them by high-speed services to the high-speed rail network.
To be successful and competitive, high-speed rail stations should be well located. 
They should be easily accessible to travellers by many modes of transport, including walking and cycling, and offer suitable public transport facilities and parking spaces at affordable prices. 
They should offer multiple well-functioning high-speed rail connections, as well as a sufficient number of trains throughout the day.
They should contribute to economic activity in the surrounding area (the â€œregenerationâ€ or â€œre-urbanisationâ€ effect).
We analysed the accessibility, connectivity and regeneration effects of 18Â high-speed rail stations (two per audited line). The full information, including the quantitative criteria used, is in Annex IX. Our analysis indicates that access to 14 stations could be improved. For example, the Meuse TGV station (Picture 3) on the LGV Est-EuropÃ©enne is poorly accessible: as the arrow shows, the station is in an isolated location in the countryside. A few local bus lines, and a small car park for private cars, provide the only means of reaching the station. 
PictureÂ 3 - The Meuse TGV station

Source: ECA.
We also found that seven stations were not appropriately sized: four were too big, and three were too small for the number of passengers. Four stations did not provide general services to the public. Five stations were not well connected, while another seven could benefit from improved connections.
By analysing changes over time (for example, in the job market, the property market, and the number of businesses attracted and jobs created), we saw no clear regeneration effects from 15 of the 18Â stations on the audited high-speed lines. The opening of the Belfort-MontbÃ©liard station on the Rhin-RhÃ´ne line had encouraged shops and a hotel to open nearby, and allowed a regional hospital to be relocated. In two other cases, upgrade works in the stations â€“ linked to the arrival of high-speed services â€“ created easier connections between neighbourhoods which were previously separated by rail tracks. This indicates that high-speed lines may accompany and support economic improvements already started and anticipated by the region, but it will not, on its own, cause a local economic boom. 
High-speed rail sustainability: effectiveness of the EU co-funding at risk

If a high-speed line is to be successful and the investment sustainable, it should be able to carry a high number of passengers. We assessed this element in two ways: by benchmarking the passenger numbers carried over time, and by analysing the number of people living in the catchment area along the line.
Passenger data analysis: three of the seven completed high-speed rail lines carry fewer passengers than the benchmark of nine million per year
Judging by a benchmark arising from academic and institutional sources, a high-speed line should ideally have nineÂ million passengers, or at least sixÂ million in the opening year to be successful. In 2016, only three lines actually carried more than nineÂ million passengers per year (Madrid-Barcelona, Turin-Salerno and LGV Est-EuropÃ©enne). On three of the seven completed high-speed lines we audited (Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Rhin-RhÃ´ne and Madrid-LeÃ³n), the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6Â billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7Â billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines. 
Catchment-area analysis of the number of people living along the lines: nine of 14 audited high-speed lines and stretches do not have sufficient high number of potential passengers
We also performed a catchment area analysis to assess the potential sustainability of operations at line level (see FigureÂ 7). AnnexÂ VIII also contains overall results and key data for all of the audited high-speed lines.
FigureÂ 7 - Catchment area analysis of the Madrid-Barcelona-French border high-speed line

Source: ECA and Eurostat.
Nine of the 14Â audited high-speed lines and cross-border connections did not have a sufficiently high number of passengers in their fifteen- and thirty-minute catchment areas along the line to make high-speed rail successful. These were the Madrid-LeÃ³n, Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Madrid-Galicia, Milano-Venezia, Rhin-RhÃ´ne, Stuttgart-Munich, Munich-Verona, Figueres-Perpignan and Basque Y lines. It is useful to note that the three lines which did not meet the passenger benchmark (see above) are also included in this criteria. 
We also analysed success of high-speed rail in a global context, to understand the reasons for success (Box 2).


Box 2 - The operations of the Shinkansen
The Shinkansen train (Picture 4) and high-speed rail operations in Japan, allow us to make a wider comparison of high-speed rail operations on a global scale. 
The 550Â km high-speed line from Tokyo to Osaka is very successful, carrying 163Â million passengers per year. There are many reasons for this success: the line connects megacities with populations of several million; trains run on dedicated tracks at a very high frequency (up to 433 trains per day); service reliability and punctuality are outstanding (in 2016, the average delay was less than 24 seconds throughout the year); and there are state-of-the-art safety and security measures in the stations and along the line, as well as sufficient support to travellers in stations.

The competitiveness of high-speed rail compared to other modes of transport: there is no â€œpolluter-paysâ€ principle yet
High-speed rail has only a limited competitive edge. Whereas the Japanese Shinkansen remains competitive even over travel distances of more than 900Â km, high-speed rail in Europe is generally competitive over travel distances of between 200 and 500Â km, with journeys lasting up to four hours. The car is the dominant transport mode on journeys of less than 200Â km because of its flexibility in the final mile, while air transport is most competitive for longer journeys.
A carbon-based taxation system is a tool to consider the impact on the environment of the different transport modes. Currently, there is no operational arrangement within any EU Member State comparable to Switzerlandâ€™s dedicated Railway Infrastructure Fund, which is part-financed from taxes imposed on lorries transiting the country. Switzerlandâ€™s approach reduces the financial burden on taxpayers for building and maintaining the railway network, since it directly channels tax income levied on one transport mode to investment support for another.
There is currently no charging system in the EU that looks at both user-pays and polluter-pays principles across the various transport modes, so as to enhance the competitiveness of rail. There have been attempts in the past to change intermodal conditions by internalising external costs from various modes of transport, but these were largely unsuccessful. The topic of taxation as a function of greenhouse-gas emissions nevertheless remains on the agenda of many governments. For example, the introduction of a cross-funding scheme is currently debated (again) in France while, in 2018, Italy will fund the Brenner Base Tunnel construction and its southern access lines with proceeds from a dedicated fund, created in 1997, from highway toll revenues.
Seamless and competitive cross-border high-speed rail operations: not yet universal
With many barriers still existing, there is a long way to go before markets become open and competitive on high-speed lines in the EU
Effective competition on high-speed lines can demonstrably improve services and reduce prices for travellers in the EU. There are currently very few cases where there is effective on-track competition on high-speed lines (there is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria). The introduction of competition on the Italian Turin-Salerno high-speed line brought better services for travellers. There are more trains to choose from (the new entrant operates 34Â daily connections in each direction in the 2017-2018Â timetable), and ticket prices have fallen by at least 24Â %. ERA staff we interviewed reported a similar positive effect for Austria: competition between the incumbent rail firm and a new entrant had brought more customers, also for the incumbent rail operator.
However, in France and Spain, the market for high-speed rail services was still not open, and there was no on-track competition on high-speed lines. These Member States wish to wait until after 2020 to assess whether the incumbent rail operator is ready for competition on long-distance passenger services. Even after that point, if the lines are deemed to operate as public-service obligations, these Member States will be able to grant a 10-year postponement under certain conditions, meaning that truly open competition may be deferred as far as 2035.
Alongside the phased opening of the market set out in the Fourth Railway Package, a number of practices persist within the rail industry which prevent a truly seamless EU high-speed rail network from becoming a reality, and potentially preventing new foreign entrants from competing on high-speed lines. These practices include technical and administrative barriers, and other hindrances to interoperability. What this means in practice for travellers is explained in BoxÂ 3.
BoxÂ 3 â€“ The impact for travellers when there is no seamless travel of trains crossing borders
The missing interoperability on the Munich-Verona stretch causes a stop and delays at the Brenner station
There are over 11Â 000 national rules in rail, which the ERA is currently categorising with a view to â€œcleaning them upâ€ at a later stage. There are no common rules for cross-border rail transport. Germany and Austria have a harmonised approach, but Italy continues to apply a different set of rules. All this results in an obligatory layover at the Austrian/Italian border: all trains must stop at the border to make the operational changes required by Italian and Austrian national legislation, which impose varying requirements. Passenger trains must stop for at least 14Â minutes (PictureÂ 5), while goods trains are delayed for 45Â minutes. Such delays are very significant, considering that the multi-billion infrastructure investment on the Munich-Verona high-speed line has an overall time-gain target of 114Â minutes.

This problem was already highlighted in the Courtâ€™s Special Report NoÂ 8/2010. Eight years later, our recommendations have not led to any changes in practice. The national authorities in the visited Member States told us that cross-border problems caused by varying national rules on employment or working languages could best be solved by the introduction of harmonised rules across the EU. Air transport, for example, uses only one working language (English); this helps to reduce barriers between continents, and could resolve similar issues between Member States.
The missing infrastructure links between France and Spain (Atlantic cross-border route) oblige passengers to change trains and platforms 
Because most of the section between Bordeaux and the Spanish border is not a priority for France, infrastructure at the border remains antiquated, incompatible and poorly suited to a modern high-speed rail network. France is not ready to invest in this infrastructure (therefore does not ask for EU funding), and this will negatively effect on Spain and Portugalâ€™s connections to the EU network along the Atlantic corridor. On the Spanish side of the border, works to connect the Basque high-speed rail network to the rest of the Spanish network are ongoing (with 318 million euros of EU co-funding). The result is that all passengers currently must change platforms and trains to cross the border (PictureÂ 6).

Track access charges: overly complicated, and a potential hindrance to competition
Under the EU legal framework for rail operations, an infrastructure manager (a separate entity from the rail operator) must allow any operator to use the rail tracks if they contribute to the costs of maintaining them. These track access charges have different impacts on the sustainability of the network. Depending on the level they are set at, they can help to recover a share of the infrastructure investment costs, and if they are set low enough, they may also encourage on-track competition by allowing new market entrants to participate.
Directive (EU) NoÂ 2012/34/EU requires track access charges to be set primarily on the basis of the costs directly incurred as a result of operating the train service. But the principles used to determine pricing across Member States differ significantly, mainly because the legislation allows many parameters to be used. In all visited Member States, â€œmark-upsâ€ had been applied to take into account specific cost categories, such as the time of day of the requested slot or the presence, or absence, of a bottleneck. 
The International Union of Railways has reported that track access charges are not calculated transparently. They regularly change, and are subject to no less than 56Â variables, leading to very different outcomes. This is confirmed by FigureÂ 8, which shows the exact level of track access charges on selected EU origin-destination pairs connected by high-speed rail, demonstrating that charging levels are indeed very different. For example, track access charges are very high in France, and much lower in Italy.

Getting the level of track access charges right is important to ensure both sustainability and competitiveness. 
In France, track access charges are kept high to provide income to the infrastructure manager, and to ensure the sustainability of operations of the infrastructure manager, which has significant debts. This reduces the need for the state to fund and maintain new high-speed rail infrastructure. At the same time, excessively high track access charges discourage new entrants from entering the market, thus shielding the incumbent rail operator from competition.
In Italy, track access charges were previously used as a means of increasing competition between the established rail operator and the new entrant. In addition to other measures (such as ensuring the right of access to station services), the Italian rail regulator lowered the charges to ensure fair competition. This improved the situation for travellers (see paragraph 85)
A strong and independent regulator: necessary, but not always a reality
This trade-off between financial sustainability and competitiveness is crucial. It is therefore important that national regulators are in place in each Member State to act, and that the Commission supervises the system. These bodies should ensure that rules governing the use of mark-ups to recover the full costs of infrastructure are applied correctly, the legal objective being the best use of the available infrastructure.
Under EU law, national rail regulatory bodies must be given extensive independence and powers to monitor railway markets to ensure that newcomers are not discriminated against, so that fair competition can develop. They should be endowed with sufficient resources. The Commission follows up on these requirements, and supports national watchdogs in their activities, and facilitates dialogue and the exchange of best practices between regulatory bodies. We observed the following two issues.
Spain is the only Member State that considers track access charges to constitute taxes, and sets them in law. This limits the management independence of the infrastructure manager and the powers of the regulator to modify them in case of non-compliance with the rules. In addition, it limits the time available to revise charges, and complicates revisions and complaints. The regulatorâ€™s position is a difficult one, because it has limited staffing and because, contrary to the provisions of the Recast Directive, its decisions are not binding on the infrastructure manager.
In France, in 2017, the regulator issued a binding negative opinion on a new model for calculating track access charges which was planned for 2018. The French government intervened by setting the level of access charges for 2018 by decree, keeping them in line with the originally applicable model. Such an approach effectively limits the power of the regulatory authority.
The Commission took action in these two cases by launching infringement proceedings. It closely monitors ongoing legislative initiatives to ensure that powers of the regulators are not eroded in the process.
Conclusions and recommendations
High-speed rail operations have many advantages but there is no realistic long term EU plan, and there is no truly EU high-speed network
High-speed rail supports the EUâ€™s sustainable mobility policy objectives, because its carbon footprint is lower than other forms of transport. It has many other benefits, such as increased safety levels; it relieves pressure on congested road networks; it allows both business and leisure passengers to travel quickly and in comfort, and it can provide socio-economic support to regions.
The Commissionâ€™s target of tripling the length of the high-speed rail network (reaching more than 30Â 000Â km in 2030) is not supported by credible analysis. We consider it unlikely that this target will be reached, because it takes around 16Â years for high-speed rail infrastructure to be planned, built, and to begin operations. By the end of 2017, only 9Â 000Â km of high-speed lines were in operation, with another 1Â 700Â km in construction.
There is no genuine European high-speed rail network: there is only a patchwork of national high-speed lines. The Commission has no power to decide if and when high-speed lines detailed in the TEN-T Regulation should be built, as decisions to build high-speed rail lines are the sole responsibility of Member States. Completing the EUâ€™s transnational corridors by linking national networks is not a priority for the Member States audited. Although an EU funding mechanism was adopted at the same time (the CEF Regulation), and although various international agreements have been signed by the Member States concerned, high-speed rail border crossing works are not being completed in a coordinated fashion. This leads to a low EU added value of the EU co-funding going to high-speed rail infrastructure investments in the Member States (paragraphs 21 to 36).
The principles of sound financial management have not consistently been applied for the audited high-speed rail infrastructure investments
The quality of the assessment of needs in the Member States is low. Alternative solutions, such as upgrading existing conventional lines instead of building new high-speed lines, are only considered systematically in Italy and Germany; this is a good practice which should be followed universally. Decisions to build are national and political; they are rarely based on proper cost-benefit analyses.
High-speed rail infrastructure is expensive, and is becoming more so: the lines we audited cost, on average, 25 million euros per kilometre. Cost-efficiency is low. While the EU budget does not suffer from cost overruns for high-speed rail investments, as the co-funded amount is capped at the initially agreed amount and any cost increase is borne by national budgets, cost overruns and delays in construction of the lines audited were the norm, and it takes a long time for lines to enter into service once built. Aggregate cost overruns are 5.7 billion euro at project level, and 25,1 billion euro at line level (44Â % and 78Â %, respectively). Delays were also significant with half of the lines facing delays of more than a decade. Our speed-yield assessment clearly indicates that very high-speed rail services are not always needed: in most cases, only around 45Â % of the design speed is achieved on average. Only two high-speed lines have average operating speeds above 200 km/h and none have speeds above 250 km/h. Our findings indicate that four of the ten lines will cost more than 100 million euros per travel minute saved. Paying careful attention to the elements above could save hundreds of millions of euros, and ensure that high-speed built lines are used well (paragraph 37 to 57).
Assessing the situation for the EU citizens highlights the advantages of high-speed rail, while the sustainability of the EU co-funding to high-speed lines is at risk
The assessment of travel times, prices and number of connections indicates that high-speed rail has advantages over its competitors (air transport, conventional rail and road transport). Our overall conclusion is that total travel time and price level are equally important factors for success. Combined with regular service (frequent trains) and reliability (punctual departures and arrivals), these factors could allow high-speed rail to increase its market share. The number of stations on a line is important, and their location vital: not all stations audited are well accessible and have good connections, and for 15 of the 18 audited high-speed rail stations we saw no clear regeneration effects in the surrounding area.
We assess that sustainability is at risk: judging by a benchmark of nine million passengers per year, three of the seven completed lines audited cannot be considered successful high-speed rail lines (Eje AtlÃ¡ntico, Rhin-RhÃ´ne and Madrid-LeÃ³n) since the number of passengers carried was far lower. The infrastructure cost of these lines was 10.6 billion euro, to which the EU provided around 2.7 billion euro. This means that there is a high risk of ineffective spending of EU co-funding on these lines, which could have been mitigated by a sound ex ante assessment of costs and benefits for the individual lines.
Our assessment of the number of people living in the catchment area of the audited lines indicates that 9 of the 14 audited lines and cross-border connections did not have enough potential passengers to be successful. In addition, high-speed rail and other transport modes do not compete equally as not all modes of transport are subject to the same charges (paragraph 58 to 85).
Seamless and competitive cross-border high-speed rail operations are still some way off
There are still many technical, administrative and other barriers to interoperability, even though the Court called for urgent action to lift such barriers in a special report published in 2010. The rail passenger market is not open in France and Spain, although there is on-track competition in Italy and, to a limited extent, in Austria. In Germany, the rail passenger market is open, but there is no competition on high-speed lines. With the current rules, competition may be delayed until as long as 2035. As competition encourages better services, more frequent trains and lower prices for travellers, it should materialise sooner.
Track access charges aim to recover previous infrastructure investment and operating costs. If they are set low enough to allow new entrants to participate in the market, they can incentivise on-track competition. However, the systems used to calculate them are overly complicated, as numerous variables can be applied. 
Each Member State must have a regulatory body, which must be qualified, adequately staffed and independent from the entity fixing the charges and from the government. This regulator must apply the rules strictly to ensure that agreed policies are respected. In two of the four cases we assessed, we found evidence that the regulators cannot exercise their statutory duties. The Commission acted upon these two cases by launching infringement procedures (paragraph 86 to 95).
Recommendation 1 â€“ The planning of the EU high-speed rail network
The Commission should, in its supervisory role, take the following steps:
1. Based on the inputs and commitments of the Member States, it should adopt a realistic long-term deployment plan for building the remaining infrastructure needed to complete the core EU high-speed rail network in the context of the revision of the TEN-T Regulation. This long-term planning should be based on the key enforceable strategic infrastructure projects on the core network, with particular focus on cross-border sections, which must be completed by 2030 to enhance EU added value.
Based on the enforceable strategic plan under 1, it should take the foreseen remedial actions if projects on these priority stretches do not begin according to the agreed timeline, if they are delayed, or if coordination problems along the various borders seem likely to prevent the line from entering into service as planned.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals for TEN-Â T.
2. It should link EU co-funding to an assessment of the need for very high-speed lines, and to closer monitoring and supervision by providing specific conditions spelled out in implementing decisions on key priority stretches. In addition, the role of European Coordinators in facilitating the implementation of cross-border projects should be strengthened, as should the connection between the core network corridor work plans and the implementation of the CEF.
Target implementation date: immediately.

Recommendation 2 â€“ EU co-funding support for high-speed rail infrastructure investments
The Commission should :
1. Revise the TEN-T regulation to enable it to enforce the timely implementation of the key strategic infrastructure networks identified above. 
Target implementation date: initiate the work as soon as possible to ensure work is completed by 2023.
2. Upon revision of the TEN-T Regulation earmark the EU co-funding support for these strategic priority projects.
Target implementation date: immediately after the revision of the TEN-T Regulation.
3.During the programming of cohesion policy, together with the Member States, focus its funding for high-speed rail lines to those high-speed rail lines that form part of the core network corridors.
Target implementation date: when preparing the programmes for the post-2020 period.
4. Make EU co-funding contingent on the introduction of an effective on-track competition on the supported high-speed lines soonest after completion of the works.
Target implementation date: immediately.
5. Link EU co-funding to beneficiaries not only to the delivery of outputs but also to the achievement of results announced. To achieve this, it should ensure the introduction of the principle of paying a fixed percentage of the EU co-funding granted to the beneficiary as a performance bonus, if it can be evidenced, from an ex-post evaluation, that the anticipated results have been exceeded. Such bonus should come from a performance reserve, similar to what currently exists in the Cohesion policy framework.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals for the post-2020 period.
6. In the upcoming CEF Regulation, together with the Member States, agree stronger enforcement tools to speed up the completion of the current obligations deriving from the TEN-T regulation.
Such enforcement tools should also tackle the situation where a Member State does not propose to timely advance on key projects in view of fulfilling the commitments taken for the completion of the core network projects.
Target implementation date: when preparing the new legislative proposals on CEF for the post-2020 period.

Recommendation 3 - Simplifying cross-border constructions
To simplify current and future major cross-border investments in high-speed rail infrastructure, the Commission should:
1. Review the rules on procurement, to have the option of a single legal framework for key cross-border infrastructure projects. This includes issues such as the language of the tendering documents, contracts and accounting systems of management bodies implementing the projects, and procedures for the settling of disputes.
2. Create, or facilitate the creation of, â€œone-stop shopsâ€, which are single bodies streamlining the various formalities to be complied with on both sides of the border.
3. Accelerate the lifting of all administrative and regulatory barriers to interoperability.
Target implementation date: by mid-2019.


Recommendation 4 â€“ Actions to improve high-speed rail operations for passengers
The Commission should:
1. Provide support to the rail sector to actively develop single e-ticketing solutions, including for high-speed rail operations.
2. Monitor Member States to ensure that they take all possible measures to implement EU rules for calculating track access charges fully and correctly, in particular in respect of the obligation to coordinate mark-ups to facilitate cross-border high-speed rail operations.
3. In its supervisory role, hold Member States to their obligations to guarantee that market access conditions for high-speed rail are supervised by independent bodies and that infrastructure managers coordinate to ensure the optimum effective use of such routes.
4. Improve the information for citizens (i) with regard to punctuality data by developing specific indicators for high-speed rail and (ii) on the basis of data already available in Commission databases (ERADIS), with regard to information on customer service satisfaction, by developing a standard reporting framework and methodology. The data and results are to be disseminated in its two-yearly Rail Market Monitoring Report.
5. Strengthen intermodal competition by setting out principles requiring the external costs of all transport modes to be adequately considered, and advocating their implementation.
Target implementation date: by the end of 2019.

A citizenâ€™s view: Assessment of travel times, prices and connections on the audited high-speed rail lines: the methodology and the data

Data collection methodology applied:
The work consisted of collecting ticket prices and travel data applicable on given dates for the origins and destinations of the audited HSL, using the transport modes of HSR, conventional rail and air, and analyzing any particular patterns discovered on the following routes. 

The first part of the work consisted of data gathering to obtain information and data on the lowest ticket price (including taxes) for buying a ticket for the day concerned, and in the most logical moment of the day for the travel community concerned, while the second part was about noting the number of travel connections between the two stations that day (indicating if there are less than 10, between 10 and 20, or over 20Â possible connections). The detailed scope of work was as follows: 
Number of different types of transportation: 3: High-speed train, Conventional train and Air (long distance coaches analysed by ECA separately);
Number of destinations / routes: 9 as indicated above;
Number of directions (every route is bi-directional; e.g. MAD-BCN and BCN-MAD): 2 but limited to origin and destination points;
Number of different starting days in week: 2 (a return ticket from Monday to Wednesday attracting usually business clients; a return ticket from Friday to Sunday, attracting usually leisure passengers);
Travel dates: 4Â weeks with approximate dates (5 to 9Â JuneÂ 2017; 3 to 7Â JulyÂ 2017; 31Â July to 4Â AugustÂ 2017, and 28Â August to 3Â SeptemberÂ 2017);
Travel times in combination with the above travel days: (Business travel: departure between 7 and 9Â AM and return between 4 and 6Â PM; Leisure travel: departure between 10 to 12Â AM and return between 5 to 7Â PM);
Number of booking times: 3 (3Â months in advance of the first day of the travel; 2 weeks in advance of the first day of the travel; â€œLast minuteâ€: the working day before the first day of travel);
The data to be gathered: Date of departure and arrival; Price in euro of the return ticket; Duration of the trip in minutes. Number of daily connections.
The data gathering work started in March 2017 to accomplish the â€˜3Â months in advanceâ€™ booking of the travel during the first date mentioned above. Priority was given on time over money for business travel trips, and money over time for leisure trips. The logic applied when booking a ticket has been i.e. if two options within the agreed timeframe are available for business traveler and one is 20Â euros cheaper but 30Â minutes slower, priority will be given to the fastest and slightly more expensive train. The same will be applicable for leisure travel: if a train is 30Â minutes longer on the way but is 20Â euros cheaper, this train will have to be selected.

Executive summary
About Erasmus+
Erasmus+ (â€œthe Programmeâ€) is an EU programme supporting actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport with a total budget of â‚¬16.45 billion for the period 2014-2020. Its aim is to provide learners and staff with the opportunity to gain skills and undergo personal, socio-educational and professional development through study, training, work experience or volunteering abroad. It also aims to improve quality and foster innovation, excellence and internationalisation in organisations working in these three fields.
A higher level objective of Erasmus+ is to help European countries to modernise and improve their education and training systems, reinforcing their role as drivers for growth, employment, competitiveness, innovation and social cohesion.
Erasmus+ covers Higher Education (HE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), School Education (SE), Adult Education, Youth and Sport. The activities and projects that can be funded under Erasmus+ are distributed between Key Actions (KA). The Programme is mostly (80Â %) implemented under indirect management by National Agencies (NA).
What we audited
We assessed the performance and European Added Value (EAV) of the Programme, focusing on KA1, Learning Mobility of individuals (â€œErasmus+ Mobilityâ€ or â€œMobilityâ€) as regards Education and Training, which represents more than half of the Programmeâ€™s budget allocation for the period 2014-2020. By January 2018 more than 2.3 million learners and practitioners had benefitted from such mobility.
What we found
Our overall conclusion is that Erasmus+ is a well-known, successful EU brand. The Programme generates many forms of EAV which go beyond the legal requirements. Erasmus+ plays a key role in building up learning mobility abroad and has a positive effect on participantsâ€™ attitudes towards the EU. Countries would not be able to achieve such effects acting alone.
In particular, we found that:
Erasmus+ Mobility provides EAV in many ways in addition to those required in the legal basis, such as a strategic approach to mobility, an increase in sense of European identity and multilingualism;
most of the targets for the indicators set in the legal basis are being met. However, these indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation making performance measurement difficult. The qualitative indicators are largely based on perceptions of participants via interviews and surveys;
Erasmus+ introduces many innovations towards administrative simplification for Mobility, although application and reporting processes are still complex;
the innovative Student Loan Guarantee Facility has not produced the expected results leading to the Commission reallocating the relevant funds.
What we recommend
We recommend that the Commission should in particular:
suggest additional EAV elements when designing and implementing the future Erasmus programme. All EAV elements should be prioritised at the project appraisal stage, monitored and reported on;
further develop indicators that help to measure the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achieved, and prioritise performance in the allocation of funds;
further simplify the scheme in order to reduce the administrative burden, make applications and reporting easier for beneficiaries and individual participants and maintain lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, but adjust the grant amounts when necessary. It should also improve IT tools and continue to computerise procedures;
promote the introduction of school student mobility in KA1 and consider applying more flexibility for PhD students;
assess the possibility of reintroducing the funding for traditional classroom language teaching; and
propose appropriate changes to the Student Loan Guarantee Facility to include doctoral and undergraduate mobility.

Introduction
Erasmus+ supports actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, with a total budget of â‚¬16.45 billion for the period 2014-2020. It aims to provide learners and staff with the opportunity to gain skills and undergo personal, socio-educational and professional development through study, training, work experience or volunteering abroad. The Programme also aims to improve quality and foster innovation, excellence and internationalisation of organisations in these three fields. The objective of Erasmus+ is also to help European countries to modernise and improve their education and training systems, reinforcing their role as drivers for growth, employment, competitiveness, innovation and social cohesion.
According to its establishing regulation (henceforth â€œthe Regulationâ€) the Programme shall contribute inter alia to the achievement of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the headline education target. It shall also contribute to the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training, including the corresponding benchmarks (â€œET 2020â€).
Erasmus+ combines the programmes from the period 2007-2013 under one Programme. The activities and projects that it funds are distributed between Key Actions (KA), as shown in Figure 1.

It manages the budget and sets priorities, targets and criteria. It guides and monitors the implementation, follow-up and evaluation of the Programme at European level. The European Commission also has responsibility for the supervision and coordination of the structures in charge of implementing the Programme at national level.
The implementation of the Erasmus+ Programme is largely (80Â %) based on indirect management (see Figure 2). The European Commission delegates implementation to National Agencies (NA) established in each Programme country. The NA are responsible for managing all stages of the project life-cycle. The NA are designated by national authority(ies), who also appoint an independent audit body in accordance with the Financial Regulation.

The most significant part of the Programme in terms of the EU Budget is KA1. It is made up of mobility projects for learners and staff in higher education, vocational education and training and adult education as well as for staff in school education and for young people. In addition KA1 provides for Erasmus Mundus Joint Masterâ€™s degrees and Erasmus+ Masterâ€™s loans.
Learning mobility provided under KA1 (moving physically to a country other than the country of residence, in order to undertake study, training or informal or non-formal learning, see Annex I for examples) is intended to improve the level of key competences and skills, with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market and their contribution to a cohesive society. Moreover, Mobility is an important means to promote the inclusion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Audit scope and approach
We assessed the performance and European Added Value (EAV) of the Erasmus+ Programme. We focused the audit on KA1 (Mobility) for Education and Training, which makes up more than half of the Programmeâ€™s budget allocation. Projects under KA2 and KA3 have an implementation period of several years and were mostly at the implementing and/or contracting stage in 2017.
In particular, we examined whether:
Erasmus+ Mobility provides the expected EAV;
the results of Erasmus+ Mobility are appropriately measured; and
innovations introduced under Erasmus+ Mobility have improved the Programme.
We selected five Programme countries to visit: Estonia, Norway, Poland, Romania and Spain. Our criteria for the selection of the countries were: (i) the number of participants they receive and send; (ii) a country receiving and sending a relatively low number of participants; (iii) a geographical spread across EU Member States and (iv) one non-EU country.
We obtained evidence from:
interviews with Erasmus+ stakeholders, including:
Commission and European Investment Fund (EIF) staff responsible for the management of Erasmus+;
the National Agencies, national authorities, beneficiaries and participants from the five selected programme countries;
a review of documentation and procedures relating to Erasmus+;
an analysis of data, including the mid-term evaluation (MTE) of Erasmus+ 2014-2016. This was published on 31 January 2018, after the end of our audit period. We reviewed this key document and found that much of it corroborated our findings. We refer to the MTE and its findings where appropriate.
Observations
Erasmus+ mobility creates more forms of European Added Value than that required in the Regulation
Erasmus+ Mobility provides the European Added Value as required by the Regulation
The Programme shall only support actions and activities which present a potential EAV and in particular those which have: transnational character, particularly with regard to mobility and cooperation aimed at achieving a sustainable systemic impact; complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies at national, Union and international level, and a contribution to the effective use of Union transparency and recognition tools.
Transnational character and systemic impact
The transnational character is by definition present. Study, training or work placements abroad are the sine qua non condition of the mobility actions in KA1: a mobility of individuals, either for study, placement, training course, job-shadowing or teaching. By January 2018 more than 2.3 million learners and practitioners had benefitted from Erasmus+ mobility under Education and Training and Youth. Figure 5 shows the number of participants who have undergone Erasmus+ mobility by country during the period 2014-2016.
Figure 5 â€“ Number of Erasmus+ mobilities by country during the period 2014-2016

Mobility by design is â€œaimed atâ€ achieving a systemic impact on the education and training systems of the Programme and partner countries. At this stage, the institutions and schools we visited were not yet able to demonstrate a particular systemic effect of their projects either on their institutions or at national level.
The Commission recognises that the systemic effect on education and training systems is â€œless visibleâ€ and that â€œthe evidence of the exploitation of project results by policy makers and the effective engagement of the latter when they are not included in the project itself is not always clearâ€ and â€œthere is only anecdotal evidence that the programme is changing institutionsâ€™ approaches to pedagogy and their target groupsâ€.
Indeed, as stated in the legal basis, individual projects are not required to have a systemic impact. It is the cumulative result of those projects that should contribute to achieving systemic impact and thus such impact may only be visible at the end of the Programme. The Programme Guide states that â€œin the long run the combined effect of the several thousands of projects supported under this Key Action is expected to have an impact on the systems of education, training and youth in the participating countries, thus stimulating policy reformsâ€.
Complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies
The complementarity and synergy with other programmes and policies are intended to be primarily ensured by the contribution of Erasmus+ to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the headline education targets. It should also contribute to the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (the mobility benchmarks in â€œETÂ 2020â€).
Whilst Erasmus+ does contribute to the mobility benchmarks, there is no apparent link between KA1 and the headline education target indicator set out in Annex I to the Regulation, as explained in paragraphsÂ 57 and 58 below.
The Commission has set out the link between Erasmus+ and Europe 2020 and ET 2020: â€œThe programme is aimed at boosting skills, employability and the modernisation of education, training and youth systems and supports actions, cooperation projects and tools linked to policy priorities of ET 2020. By doing so, it also contributes to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular the country-specific recommendations in the field of education and training. Investment from Erasmus+ will benefit individuals, institutions and society as a whole, thus contributing to jobs, growth and competitiveness and enhancing prosperity and social inclusionâ€.
In the programme countries we visited we found that the mobility measures do boost skills and employability, notably in the VET sector. At the Programme level, the Mid-term evaluation contains evidence that HE and VET students who have participated in mobility have better employment and salary prospects than their non-mobile equivalents, although much of this evidence so far relates to predecessor programmes.
Feedback from participants reveals very high satisfaction with Erasmus+ mobility and its effect on their employability. For example, 93.8Â % of respondents as at January 2018 declared that they had increased their key competences. 93Â % of staff say they learnt new good practices, 75Â % stating that they had returned with practical skills relevant for their current job. 79.1Â % declared that they had increased their employability. Such feedback, whilst informative and encouraging, may be subjective (see paragraphsÂ 80 to 82).
The 2015 Erasmus+ Annual Report sets out the link between Erasmus+ and other EU policy developments, such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (education and training to restore jobs and growth), and states that â€œthroughout 2015 Erasmus+ implemented the existing EU policy agendas of promoting inclusive learning mobility and cooperation between the various stakeholders involved in the education, training and youth sectorsâ€.
Some Member States use other EU funds to finance mobility via the Erasmus+ mechanisms. For example, Poland tailored its European Social Fund (ESF) Operational Programme in 2016 to finance 2Â 500 School Education participants and 17Â 200 VET participants in Erasmus+. Disadvantaged students also receive additional funds from the ESF.
Contribution to the effective use of EU transparency and recognition tools
Transparency
The Programme Guide states that â€œactivities serving the dissemination and exploitation of results are a way to showcase the work that has been done as part of the Erasmus+ project. Sharing results, lessons learned and outcomes and findings beyond the participating organisations will enable a wider community to benefit from a work that has received EU fundingâ€.
Over 80 success stories have been highlighted in DG EAC's dissemination platforms for Erasmus+. 120 factsheets and 10 videos have been produced on the success stories selected in 2015 and 2016, giving further visibility to these projects. They have been promoted via social media, websites and DG EAC's newsletter, as well as during events. In 2017 the Commission started to publish a monthly Erasmus+ online newsletter, which features a number of success stories. Erasmus+ is the biggest DG-specific Facebook page in the Commission (with nearly 300Â 000 followers).
A new platform (VALOR, or Project Results Dissemination Platform) was established for Erasmus+ to offer a comprehensive overview of projects funded under the Programme and to highlight good practice examples and success stories. The platform makes available products, deliverables and intellectual outputs which are the result of the projects funded. It gives open internet access to descriptions, results and contact information for all projects funded under the Erasmus+ programme, as well as some of the projects funded under its predecessor programmes.
We found evidence that the five countries visited and the Commission are very active in disseminating the results of their projects. 
Recognition
Erasmus+ encourages the recognition of credits earned during mobility. Recognition of credits was not considered to be a problem by the beneficiaries and participants met during our audit. In 2016, a recognition rate of 100Â % was reported for higher education (73Â % in 2013) and 77Â % for VET. The need to earn credits ensures that students have to be assiduous during their mobility.
In the context of VET, the Europass system certifies the international element of the training and gives potential employers more assurance, thereby making the VET students more employable.
Erasmus+ provides European Added Value in additional ways
The EAV of Erasmus+ can be defined as the positive effect brought about by the Programme which would not have occurred without it. Based on this definition we identified additional ways in which Mobility provides EAV, going beyond the EAV sought in the Regulation.
The system of Charters
All participating Programme country HE institutions (both sending and receiving) must obtain the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE). This Charter, developed under the previous Programme, is a guarantee of quality course provision across Europe. No single country would be capable of setting up such a system. We found cases where universities had applied for the Charter just to be able to have it as a mark of quality. The Erasmus+ programme has developed the recognition of credits earned on mobility. The Charter has greatly facilitated this.
Erasmus+ is encouraging VET institutions to apply for the VET Charter. This recently-created Charter is similarly a guarantee of quality and boosts the reputation and attractiveness of a VET institution. We likewise found cases where VET institutions had applied for the VET charter just to be able to have it as a mark of quality.

Network of cooperation and harmonisation of university curricula
Mobility has helped foster cooperation between universities, creating international offices complemented by a system of standard documentation and tools to support student and staff mobility. Changes have been made in university curricula to facilitate student mobility, synchronising the semesters, study periods and the availability of courses across countries. This cooperation also facilitates the transfer of credits and mutual recognition of modules completed and diplomas gained whilst on mobility.
In the HE and VET sectors, Learning Agreements (LA) are drawn up between learners and receiving institutions. These are a form of institutionalised guarantee that credits earned on mobility will be recognised. Signing a LA is a strong predictive indicator for later recognition of the mobility.
In the projects we visited, mobility of HE and Schools staff and VET learners led to subsequent cooperation and exchanges outside Erasmus+.
A strategic approach to mobility
Under Erasmus+ it is HE institutions, VET institutions and schools that apply for Mobility projects to be approved, rather than students/individual teachers. This is a major change from previous programmes which in our view contributes to institutional development. Benefits accrue to the HE institutions who have to propose and implement an internationalisation strategy. VET providers and schools must draw up a European Development Plan, setting out how the proposed mobility project fits with the needs of the institution and its overall development.
This strategic approach helps ensure management buy-in to the objectives of a project as well as longer term retention of links and know-how, creating more sustainable added value.
EAV of mobility of teaching staff
Teaching staff who have been on mobility should put into practice what theyâ€™ve learned upon their return. For example university staff in Estonia and VET staff in Poland stated that they put their mobility experience to use in their home institutions.
Multilingualism
One of the specific objectives of the Programme is to improve the teaching and learning of languages and to promote the EU's linguistic diversity. Language skills contribute to the mobility, employability and personal development of European citizens.
One of the indicators set out in Annex I of the Regulation is the percentage of participants declaring that they have increased their language skills. The score for this indicator is over 96Â % (but see also paragraphÂ 81). Mobility abroad is instrumental in producing such a score.
Lack of language skills can still hold back mobility students, notably outside the HE sector. Our interviews with participants showed that, particularly in the VET sector, lack of language skills can hold back participants and prevent the mobility placement leading directly to employment. The lack of language ability prevented Spanish VET students we met, for example, from obtaining jobs at the end of their mobility in Berlin. Linguistic barriers were cited by respondents to the Open Public Consultation supporting the mid-term evaluation as the most frequent barrier to the achievement of programme objectives.
Cross-border and international mobility
Mobility is an important part of education strategy in most countries. For example Norway has a target of 20Â % of students to participate in cross-border mobility, Estonia has set up a portal -StudyinEstonia- to attract foreign students and Spain would like to co-operate more intensively with South America, by helping to set up international offices and capacity building. Erasmus+ is a very important means and model to achieve this (see FigureÂ 5).
Erasmus+ as part of the EUâ€™s neighbourhood and development policy
Funds are made available from the EU Budget, as provided for in various external instruments, under Erasmus+ in order to promote the international dimension of HE. This funding is allocated to actions in respect of learning mobility between Programme countries and partner countries. Student and staff mobility to or from partner countries funded through the allocation from the DCI must focus on areas that are relevant to the inclusive and sustainable development of developing countries.
In this way Erasmus+ is a form of EU soft power and diplomacy, a political EAV. Development and neighbourhood policies are implemented through the Programme, notably HE mobility with partner countries (see Figure 5).
Under the predecessor programme such projects were assessed at the EU level. Under Erasmus+ projects are assessed in each programme country. This may lead to a reduction in quality as a minimum number of projects are selected in each country.
Increased prominence and prestige of VET
17Â % of the total Erasmus+ budget is dedicated to VET. This compensates for limited national funds available for exchanges of students, teachers and staff in VET. Moreover, VET student exchanges help to make the VET institutions and VET itself more attractive and prestigious. More and more students and staff are participating in VET mobility (see FigureÂ 7).
Figure 7 â€“ Significant increase in VET mobility (students and staff)

VET brings Erasmus+ closer to a greater variety of citizens
The inclusion of VET in Erasmus+ brings the Programme closer to a greater variety of citizens, dealing with a wider range of less academic domains (e.g. catering or car-bodywork). Moreover, the inclusion of such disciplines under Erasmus+ provides opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to benefit from mobility. Many of the VET students we met had never left their country, or even their region, before going on their mobility. Annex II shows examples of the types of mobility in the VET sector in the schools/countries visited.
Increase in sense of European identity
The mobility participants we met stated that this participation has increased their sense of European identity. The mid-term evaluation also found that participating in Erasmus+ mobility fostered a sense of feeling European (19Â % more than in non-participants). Moreover, the general public perceives the Programme, and Mobility in particular as it is the most visible part, as one of the pillars of European identity and as a concrete benefit that the EU provides to its citizens. Erasmus+ is one of the most recognisable brands of the EU. 
Thus, Erasmus+ generates many forms of EAV which go beyond the legal requirements. Erasmus+ indeed plays a key role in building up learning mobility abroad and has a very positive effect on participantsâ€™ attitudes towards the EU. Countries would not be able to achieve such effects acting alone.
The performance measurement of Erasmus+ Mobility has weaknesses in certain key areas
Effective performance management, including evaluation and monitoring, requires the development of specific, measurable and realistic performance indicators which can be measured over time and which reflect the logic of the intervention. This intervention logic is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8 - Erasmus+ KA1 Mobility Intervention Logic Model

Source: ECA.
The general objectives of Erasmus+, as far as Education and Training is concerned, are to contribute to the achievement of: the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the headline education target; the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) as well as the corresponding benchmarks; the sustainable development of partner countries in the field of higher education; and the promotion of European values in accordance with article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union. Specific objectives for Education and Training relevant for KA1 mobility are set out in Article 5.
The specified targets are being met, but some indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation
Some of the indicators set out in the Regulation need to be improved to better serve the performance assessment framework
The Programme has a set of indicators for its evaluation. These indicators are described as â€œmeasureable and relevantâ€ and â€œintended to measure the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achievedâ€. Those indicators set for KA1 Mobility are shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9 - Indicators for the evaluation of the Programme

Source: Annex I of the Regulation.
We examined whether these indicators are appropriate. The Commission claims that â€œthe programme is on track to achieve or exceed the vast majority of the targetsâ€.
It is not clear how the Mobility projects financed help meet the Europe 2020 headline education target
The Europe 2020 indicators were set by the Council. The Commission reported â€œThe indicators linked to Europe 2020 education headline target, namely tertiary educational attainment and early school leaving showed continuous progress (â€¦) In 2016, the early school leaving rate in the EU was 10.8Â % that is 2Â decimal points lower than in 2015 (...) At the same time, the EU average percentage of people aged 30-34 with a tertiary education degree rose by 3Â decimal points to 39.0Â % in 2016â€.
However, it is not clear how the projects financed under Mobility, help meet these headline education targets. Moreover, even if they did contribute, that contribution cannot be distinguished from that of other national and EU actions and separately measured.
Thus, there is no apparent link between Mobility, or even Erasmus+ as a whole and the headline education target indicators. These Europe 2020 indicators are not aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation as required by article 5(2).
As the mobility benchmark only contains partial results, it is not being properly measured
In 2011, Member States agreed on the EU benchmark for higher education mobility, whereby in 2020 at least 20Â % of higher education graduates should have had a period of higher education-related study or training (including work placements) abroad.
They also set a benchmark for learning mobility in VET: by 2020 at least 6Â % of VET graduates should have had VET-related study or a training period abroad (including work placements).
Higher education mobility in Erasmus+ is a key driver to meet the benchmark for mobility in that sector. The mobility benchmark is clearly linked to KA1. However, Erasmus+ is not the only programme contributing to mobility and thus the contribution from Erasmus+ cannot be fully identified.
Moreover, the data underpinning this benchmark is only available on a very partial basis according to analysis undertaken by the Centre for Research on Lifelong Learning (CRELL), and it is not available on a comparable basis across Europe. Thus the results for this indicator are not accurate.
A comprehensive assessment of the level of mobility in VET is not possible because of limited data availability. Eurostat undertook a pilot survey to assess VET learning mobility which it completed at the end of 2015. The results showed that in the 17 Programme countries participating in the survey, around 3.1Â % of VET students had taken part in learning mobility.
As this indicator only contains partial results, it is not being properly measured.
The quantitative (general) indicators provide useful information, although some definitions need to be harmonised and refined
These indicators relate specifically to Mobility and are reported and monitored by the Commission. Progress (as at the end of 2016) towards the targets for these indicators, which are set in the DG EAC Annual Work Programme, is summarised in Figure 10.
Figure 10 - Quantitative (general) Indicators

Source: Annual Activity Report, DG EAC, 2016.
Erasmus+ Mobility promotes the inclusion of learners with fewer opportunities. It is not clear why the indicator in the legal basis groups such participants with those with special needs. Moreover, according to the 2016 Erasmus+ Annual Report â€œthe Programme continues to fight barriers to mobility by becoming more inclusive for those from a disadvantaged background and those with special needsâ€. Thus, this terminology is not being used consistently.
Nearly 205Â 000 participants from disadvantaged backgrounds and with fewer opportunities benefitted from Erasmus+ by taking part in transnational mobility activities over the period 2014-2017. Erasmus+ Mobility has offered new experiences abroad to many people who would otherwise have not been able to afford it.
The definition of â€œdisadvantaged/fewer opportunitiesâ€ differs in each Programme country. For example in Spain, all beneficiaries receiving a government grant for studies are included in this category. Indeed, according to the Commissionâ€™s data, over 35Â % of mobility participants from disadvantaged backgrounds are from Spain.
Consequently, the results for this indicator do not provide an accurate comparison of such mobility across EU countries. The Commission recognises that one of the main issues that affected the analysis of participation patterns is â€œthe absence of a harmonised definition, across sectors, of people with fewer opportunities and from disadvantaged backgroundsâ€ and that â€œthe quality of the data on participation of disadvantaged groups is unclear due to various definitions and practicesâ€.
These three indicators measure outputs of the Programme and help to demonstrate progress in implementation. Thus, they provide little information about the outcomes and impact of the Programme (see Figure 8).
Education and Training indicators are being met, but they do not address the extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achieved
The Education and Training indicators in Annex I to the Regulation are specific to the Programme. Progress under these indicators for 2016 are shown in FigureÂ 11 and FigureÂ 12 below, which indicate that most targets are being met.
Education and Training indicators (a) to (d) in Figure 11 are output indicators. Even though these quantitative indicators are useful they do not fully measure â€œthe extent to which the general and specific objectives of the Programme have been achievedâ€, notably the specific objectives, as required in Annex I of the Regulation.
Figure 11 - Output indicators

Source: Annual Activity Report, DG EAC, 2016.
Indicators (e) to (g) are outcome indicators that provide information about the benefits of participating in the Programme. Indicator (f) is a subjective measure, based on the perception of the individual, as reported at the end of the mobility.
Figure 12 - Outcome indicators

Source: Annual Activity Report, DG EAC, 2016.
The Commission recognises the limitations of these indicators in that â€œthey are mostly based on the self-perceived contribution of KA1 reported by beneficiariesâ€. It states that the National Reports, underlying the MTE, report improvements in the level of key competences and skills in learners, but it recognises that this is â€œmostly based on the self-reported perceptions of participantsâ€.
The Dashboard provides real-time information about outputs and outcomes
In 2016 the Commission launched its Erasmus+ Dashboard, which is a single data warehouse collecting all the information that is recorded by the NA and the beneficiaries. The data is updated on a daily basis and provides real-time, qualitative and quantitative data relating to the implementation of the Programme in terms of projects, grants, participants and organisations involved in the Programme. It records the survey and post-mobility declarations of participants and beneficiaries.
According to the Dashboard, participant satisfaction is high: 95.8Â % were satisfied with their learning mobility experience (as at January 2018) and 80Â % felt better prepared for finding a job. Indeed Erasmus+ is a success, based on the survey and post-mobility declarations.
The sources used to measure performance in the mid-term evaluation are to a large extent surveys and participant feedback
The MTE report on the Erasmus+ Programme was submitted on 31 January 2018. It builds on: National Reports of the Programme countries, an evaluation report by an external contractor, other reviewed studies, experience in managing the programme, and over a million responses from interested parties. In respect of Erasmus+ it covers the period 2014-2016.
The sources for the MTE are to a large extent surveys and participant feedback: â€œThe evaluation combined a number of techniques for data collection and analysis. Most results are reached by a mix of evidence... based on beneficiariesâ€™ surveys, self-reported feedback of beneficiaries, as well as qualitative interviews and case studiesâ€. In addition an Open Public Consultation gathered the opinions of the general public and interested groups.
Our meetings with the compilers of the National Reports in the five countries visited indicated difficulties arising from the lack of robust data to help in assessing the impacts of the Programme.
Post-mobility questionnaire for participants is subjective and complex
After completion of the mobility, each participant has to fill in a questionnaire to evaluate overall satisfaction and specific aspects of participation in the Programme, such as home institution recognition of the mobility, increase in sense of European identity and improvement in language skills.
This participant feedback is useful but, as it is subjective, should not be used as the main measure for assessing the quality and results of a mobility. It is all the more subjective as the final payment to the student is conditional on the questionnaire being completed, although such payment is not conditional on a positive self-assessment.
The students we met said that the questionnaires were too complex (in particular for VET) and use too much EU jargon. Some students reported difficulties in filling in the questionnaires. For example the Norwegian NA stated that the questions are not appropriate for VET students.
Little continuity from year to year in the priorities in the Erasmus+ Annual Work Programmes
The Commission established policy priorities for Erasmus+ in 2014. Some of these have been maintained in subsequent AWP, while others have been discontinued and new policy priorities introduced.
The priority â€œSystemic changes of education and training systems with a view to increasing their labour market relevance, through enhanced work-based learning opportunitiesâ€, introduced in 2014, is not included in subsequent AWP.
None of the 2014 priorities for VET remain in the 2017 AWP. However, each subsequent year saw additional priorities. In HE, the priority â€œto increase attainment levelsâ€ was withdrawn from the 2017 AWP and new priorities were introduced.
These priorities are relevant, however no quantitative targets or indicators have been set. It is not clear to what extent the objectives of these priorities have been met, nor why many were discontinued. There has been little continuity from year to year in the priorities established by DG EAC in the Erasmus+ AWP.
The allocation of funds is not based on performance
The allocation of funds should be based on performance to promote an efficient and effective use of resources. The Regulation requires that the criteria used to measure performance focus on â€œthe level of annual realised outputs and the level of annual payments realisedâ€.
We do not consider these criteria sufficient to measure the performance of the Programme. They merely measure how much can be spent (inputs and outputs). Performance also covers outcomes and impact as recognised in the Regulation.
To conclude, the performance measurement of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas. Targets are being met but the indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation, making performance measurement difficult.
Erasmus+ has introduced many innovations but some of them have not yet reached maturity
Consolidation under Erasmus+ is a success
Erasmus+ combines the programmes from the period 2007-2013 under one Programme (see Figure 1). In respect of mobility, it includes the former ErasmusÂ (HE), LeonardoÂ (VET) and ComeniusÂ (SE) Programmes. The NA we met -and in a paper by all NA Directors- consider this to be positive. Having a single brand name brings better visibility at the political level and for the public and contributes to increasing the sense of European identity (see paragraphÂ 50).
The indirect management approach is positive
The indirect management approach increases the effectiveness of projects. Being close to the beneficiaries, NA can better contribute to improving the quality of project proposals and their implementation, adapting them to the diversity of national education and training systems. The beneficiaries we interviewed confirmed that the NA provide good assistance and feedback during the application and implementation phases and organised events and training courses to facilitate access to the Programme.
Erasmus+ introduces many innovations towards administrative simplification, although application and reporting processes are still complex
The implementation of the Programme should be simplified by reducing formal and bureaucratic requirements for beneficiaries and Member States. Streamlining and simplifying the organisation and management, and a sustained focus on reducing administrative expenditure, are vital to the success of the Programme.
Only a minority of NA (36Â %) find Erasmus+ to be a lesser burden than predecessor programmes. Beneficiaries and participants still find the programme complex (applications, implementation, reporting). Participants interviewed found project application and reporting for VET to be repetitive, with the same information to be provided in several instances. Smaller organisations considered the need to describe the â€œEuropean impactâ€ of their individual mobility projects to be excessive.
Participants in nearly every country complained about complex administrative procedures related to applications and reporting. We found that some students consider the LA to be complicated to fill in and students can find that the content of a course has been changed upon their arrival. Course catalogues are sometimes not updated. This can cause disappointment on arrival as some students find that their intended course no longer exists.
Some of the participants we met found application forms to be too complex for schools. One particular difficulty is in setting out how the projects will meet the objectives in the European Development Plan. Application forms have been simplified for the 2018 call.
The Commission has produced a comprehensive Programme Guide intended to help the beneficiary organisations and individual participants. It is updated every year. However, it is difficult to identify the changes made from year to year in the Programme Guides, as these are not indicated. The NA we visited stated that they would appreciate an online handbook (currently in pdf format) with all the source documents -and marked updates- in one single document. The 2017 Programme Guide has since been made available online.
Some of the institutions we met felt the rules for HE mobility with partner countries to be too complex. The implementation of such mobility was very difficult during the first year, with 10 amendments to the financial agreement between the university and theÂ NA. In this area simplification has not yet been achieved.
Lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are a good simplification, but the Commission should ensure that undesired effects are avoided
The implementation of Erasmus+ was simplified by the use of lump sum, flat rate and unit cost funding. The mid-term review on simplification of grants found that the use of such funding has led to many financial and non-financial benefits in the implementation of the Programme. It simplified budget planning, reporting to the NA and accounting. Moreover, the review found that, because of the reduced administrative burden, programme beneficiaries are able to focus on project content during the planning stage and on achievement of their projectâ€™s aims during the implementation stage.
We found that stakeholders appreciate the introduction of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs which have brought about simplification in the financial management of the programme.
However, in order to enhance access to Erasmus+, the grants to support the mobility of individuals should be adjusted to the living and subsistence costs of the host country.
The lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are set out in the Programme Guide and are divided into three groups: countries with similar, higher and lower living costs. Some students and institutions we met reported that Erasmus+ grants are insufficient to cover costs and that additional funding is needed from a studentâ€™s own savings or parental support. This can discourage disadvantaged students from taking part.
We found that no adjustments to grant amounts are made to reflect the real costs for participants in the case where the receiving country provides specific subsidies, e.g. a studentâ€™s rent is often paid by the State in France, which means that such participants are in an advantageous situation.
Unit costs based on distance bands do not take into account the existence or frequency of connections or differences in prices between tourist destinations and geographically remote places. Using the distance calculator benefits those located in major cities with airports.
Following comments from NA the Commission has made adjustments to certain elements for the 2017 call, for example top-ups for expensive domestic travel costs. Moreover, based on evidence provided by the mid-term review on the simplification of grants, adjusted funding rules will apply as of 2018.
The introduction of IT systems was problematic, but most issues have now been resolved
The introduction of a large number of IT tools at the beginning of the Programme caused confusion for NA and applicants. The IT tools provided by the Commission were initially of variable quality and were introduced late. The Mobility Tool was considered unreliable and not user-friendly and many issues were only gradually taken into account (e.g. eForms, EPlusLink and OEET). All of the countries we visited reported problems in integrating the new tools, which had not been piloted before their introduction.
The Commission resolved most of the problems with the introduction of its 2016 IT Action Plan. The improvements were confirmed by the NA during our visits.
We found that NA, beneficiaries and participants would welcome more electronic documentation, leading to a paperless Erasmus+. Many Erasmus+ documents were still in paper format.
The Online Linguistic Support is a useful tool. However, the non-online courses funded under the previous programme are considered essential
One of the specific objectives of Erasmus+ is to improve the teaching and learning of languages.
The Commission has created the Online Linguistic Support (OLS), giving learners the opportunity to assess their skills in the foreign language they will use to study or work in the host country, as well as to follow an online language course to improve their level.
All mobility participants have to complete an online linguistic assessment to evaluate their language skills before and after the completion of their mobility. Such results would provide quantifiable data on improvement in such skills. The OLS test is compulsory in order to obtain the final grant payment.
We found that in a number of instances the scores achieved in the questionnaire upon completion indicate that the language skills have remained the same or even decreased. The Commission believes that apparent decreases in language levels between the first and final assessment reflect a lack of motivation on part of the participants due to the lack of incentives at this stage of their mobility. Thus these final tests, although essential, should be treated with care when measuring improvements in linguistic ability.
According to some HE institutions the OLS tests do not generate language competence certificates which meet the recognition criteria imposed by many European universities. Indeed the Coimbra group of universities believes that there is an over-emphasis on online language tests and weak support for effective on-site language courses.
Some VET participants also regret the absence of non-online language courses under Erasmus+, for which funding was available under the previous programme. In Estonia for example the absence of language courses in an auditorium is regretted as these were better at encouraging learners.

The Student Loan Guarantee Facility has not met expectations
The Student Loan Guarantee Facility provides partial guarantees to financial intermediaries in respect of loans granted â€œon the most favourable terms possibleâ€ to students undertaking a second-cycle degree, such as a Masterâ€™s degree, in another Programme country.
The Facility is managed and implemented by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the Commission. Up to 3.5Â % of the total Erasmus+ budget was originally assigned to this Facility.
The objective was to provide â‚¬3 billion of loans to 200Â 000 Master students by 2020, thereby boosting student mobility in Europe in line with the EU's 20Â % Mobility benchmark target.
The EIFâ€™s Delegation Agreement with the Commission provides targeted incentives for it to select a financial intermediary from each Programme country, in order to ensure that students from all such countries have access to the Facility. Despite EIF conducting a market survey which revealed significant interest from such intermediaries, and the EIF actively promoting the Facility to over 120 financial institutions, the subsequent calls for expression of interest did not attract many of them. At the end of 2017 the scheme was only operating via one such intermediary in each of France and Turkey (outgoing students only), and Spain (outgoing and incoming students).
By then only 358Â Master students had received such a loan. Although feedback from participating students was positive, 77Â % confirming that they would not have been able to study for their Masterâ€™s degree abroad without the loan guaranteed through the scheme, the target of up to 200Â 000 students is unlikely to be met. At the end of 2017 the Commission reallocated the relevant funds.
One of the reasons for the lack of interest from financial intermediaries may be that the Regulation makes the protection for borrowers too inflexible, not taking sufficient account of standard market practices. This protection is specifically set out in paragraphÂ 2 of AnnexÂ II of the Regulation.
Moreover, the Facility covers a narrow target population (Master students), excluding sizeable segments of students, which further reduced the interest of financial intermediaries.
In 2017 EIF concluded agreements with the Universities of Luxembourg and Cyprus, whereby the latter will allow incoming Master students to defer payment of their tuition and accommodation costs for two years, covered by guarantees agreed under the Facility. This innovative approach is positive, as universities are increasingly playing a role in financing higher education.
Other features new to Erasmus+ need attention
It is no longer possible for school students to participate in mobility under KA1
Participation in mobility under KA1 is no longer possible for school students. National Agencies and schools in the countries visited regretted the absence of such mobility. Moreover, it is anomalous that students of the same age can participate in VET mobility, but not as school students under KA1.
Many VET institutions have difficulties in finding partners and often have to resort to intermediaries
The VET institutions we visited reported difficulties in finding partners for high quality mobility. Examples of such difficulties are in Figure 14. Some resort to using intermediaries, which can be expensive and reduce the funding available for mobility. The VET institutions visited would appreciate more support from the Commission and NA in finding partners.
Moreover, whereas Leonardo covered expenses such as preparatory visits for teachers to inspect new host partners, this is no longer the case under Erasmus+. VET institutions expressed the wish for more support to enable the administrative staff and teachers to accompany students at the beginning and end of mobility, as well as preparatory visits. Accompanying visits are very important as the students are often teenagers and for many it is their first time abroad.
The Commission has recently created an online map of VET Charter holders where colleges can seek partnerships with colleges abroad which are deemed to be reliable.

Flexibility for PhD students is needed
Under previous schemes it was possible to organise short, intensive programmes that were highly appreciated especially by PhD students. Currently the minimum period allowed is three months. The Higher Education institutions we visited argued that such students need more flexibility and that a period of one month better reflects their availability.
Conclusions and Recommendations
We found that Erasmus+ is a well-known, successful EU brand. The Programme generates many forms of EAV, many of which go beyond the legal requirements. Targets are being met but the performance assessment framework of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas so as to measure the extent to which general and specific objectives are being met. Innovative features and simplification measures have been introduced, but some stakeholders still find key aspects cumbersome.
The Erasmus+ Mobility actions satisfy the EAV criteria set out in the legal basis (see paragraphsÂ 14 to 31). We have identified additional ways in which these actions generate EAV (see paragraphsÂ 32 to 51).
Although most targets specified for the programme are being met, we found that the indicators are not fully aligned with the general and specific objectives set out in the Regulation, making performance measurement difficult. Therefore, the performance assessment framework of Erasmus+ Mobility needs to be further improved in certain key areas (see paragraphsÂ 52 to 88). The systemic impact of Mobility has not yet been demonstrated (see paragraphsÂ 16 to 18).
Most indicators are quantitative and output-based. The qualitative ones are largely based on perceptions of stakeholders and participants via interviews and surveys. Participant feedback is useful but, as it can be subjective, should not be used as the main measure to assess the quality and results of the mobility actions (see paragraphsÂ 54 to 82).
The performance criteria for the allocation of funds set by the Regulation are merely measures of inputs and outputs, and not outcomes and impacts. In our view performance has to be assessed in terms of progress towards achieving objectives in order to comply with the Regulation. Moreover, there is little continuity of policy priorities for Erasmus+ from year to year (see paragraphsÂ 83 to 88).
Erasmus+ introduced many positive innovations, notably to simplify and reduce the administrative burden for participants, beneficiary institutions and NA. However, improvements are still needed to make participation less burdensome and more attractive for beneficiaries, notably in the application and reporting processes. Only a minority of NA (36Â %) find Erasmus+ to involve a lesser burden than predecessor programmes (see paragraphsÂ 90 to 97).
Lump sums, flat rates and unit costs are a good simplification, but the Commission should ensure that unwarranted effects are avoided (see paragraphsÂ 98 to 104).
The introduction of IT systems was very problematic at first, but most issues had been resolved by 2017. Nevertheless the MTE found that â€œprocedures and IT management tools should be made easier to use to reduce the administrative burden on implementing bodies and beneficiariesâ€. E-applications need to be encouraged (see paragraphsÂ 105 to 107).
The Online Linguistic Support is a useful complementary tool for self-learning and testing the language level. However, it could in future be supplemented by non-online courses funded under the previous programme (see paragraphsÂ 108 to 113).
In respect of the Student Loan Guarantee Facility, the participation of financial intermediaries is limited, and the intended impact is not being achieved. The EIF has sought innovative and flexible solutions. Expanding the potential loan portfolio to other cycles in the successor programme might increase the attractiveness of the scheme for financial intermediaries (see paragraphsÂ 114 to 121).
Recommendation 5
The Commission should:
propose appropriate regulatory and legislative changes to widen the Student Loan Guarantee Facility to include doctoral and undergraduate mobility;
take appropriate action to encourage Programme countries to ensure that their National Promotional Institutions participate in the existing Facility.
Target implementation date: (a) first semester 2021, (b) 2018.
We found significant demand for the reintroduction of school student mobility in Erasmus+ Key ActionÂ 1 (see paragraphÂ 122).
The minimum mobility period of three months for PhD students is not always appropriate. Such students need more flexibility (see paragraphÂ 126).

GLOSSARY AND ABBREVIATIONS
CF: Cohesion Fund
Concept of cost-effectiveness: It concerns the ability or potential of an 
audited entity, activity, programme or operation to achieve certain outcomes at 
a reasonable cost. Cost-effectiveness analyses are studies of the relationship 
between project cost and outcomes, expressed as cost per unit of outcome 
achieved . The concept is also emphasised in the EU’s financial rules (see 
paragraph 6). 
CO2: Carbone dioxide
Deadweight: Deadweight occurs where funding is provided to support a 
beneficiary who would have made the same choice in the absence of aid. In 
such cases, the outcome cannot be attributed to the policy, and the aid paid to 
the beneficiary has had no direct impact. 
EIA: Environmental Impact Assessment
ERDF: European Regional Development Fund
EU added value: On a general level, EU added value is the value resulting 
from an EU intervention which is additional to the value that would have been 
otherwise created by Member State action alone.
Feed-in tariff (FIT):  A policy mechanism designed to accelerate investment in 
renewable energy technologies by offering long-term contracts to renewable 
energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology. 
MS: Member State
PV: Photovoltaic
RES: Renewable energy sources - energy from renewable non-fossil sources, 
namely wind, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal and ocean energy, 
hydropower, biomass, landfill gas, sewage treatment plant gas and biogases:
*	Geothermal energy means energy stored in the form of heat beneath the 
surface of solid earth.
*	Biomass means the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and 
residues from biological origin from agriculture (including vegetal and 
animal substances), forestry and related industries including fisheries and 
aquaculture, as well as the biodegradable fraction of industrial and 
municipal waste.
*	Solar energy means radiant light and heat from the sun harnessed using a 
range of technologies such as solar heating, solar photovoltaic  and solar 
thermal electricity.
*	Wind power means the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of 
energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power.

RES 2020 targets: Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy, to be  
implemented by Member States by December 2010, set mandatory national 
targets for all Member States so that by 2020 the EU will achieve a share of 
20 % of energy from renewable sources in general and of 10 % in the transport 
sector particularly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	This audit sought to answer the question of whether good results had been 
achieved by the two most important funding sources among EU spending 
programmes for promoting renewable energy - the European Regional 
Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund (Cohesion policy funds).
II.	Approximately 4,7 billion euro was allocated for renewable energy in the 
2007 - 2013 programming period. The Court examined whether funds in that 
period had been allocated to well prioritised, cost-effective and mature 
renewable energy generation projects with rational objectives and to what 
extent these funds had achieved good results in contributing to the EU 2020 
target for energy from renewable sources (RES).
III.	The Court found that the 24 audited  RES generation projects delivered 
outputs as planned. Most of the audited RES projects were sufficiently mature 
and ready for implementation when selected. There were no major cost 
overruns or time delays in the projects and the RES generation capacities were 
installed as planned and operational. No major risks to their technical 
sustainability were apparent.
IV.	In one third of the audited projects the energy production targets had been 
achieved (or almost achieved) and properly measured.  The Court found that 
the overall value for money of Cohesion policy funds support to RES 
generation projects has been limited in helping achieve the EU RES 2020 
target, because:
*	cost-effectiveness has not been the guiding principle in planning and 
implementing the RES generation projects, and
*	cohesion policy funds had a limited EU added value.
V.	In more detail, the Court found potential for improvements in the Member 
States covered by the audit: some procurement processes did not ensure full 
transparency, fairness and efficiency in contractors’ selection; preparation was 
insufficient for effective monitoring and evaluation; programmes did not explain 
how the EU funds could contribute cost-effectively to reaching the RES 
objectives; cost-effectiveness of measures in different RES sectors was not 
always considered when the budgets were earmarked; and the programmes 
failed to establish performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation.
VI.	The Court concludes that improvements are needed if funding under these 
programmes is to make the maximum possible contribution to achieving the 
RES 2020 targets.
VII.	Cohesion policy spending, in general, brings benefits to the broader 
economy, and although the direct measurement of economic growth or job 
creation - the overarching aims of Cohesion policy - was outside the scope of 
this audit, the Court’s observations and recommendations are also made in the 
context of these policy aims.
VIII.	In view of a likely enhanced use of EU funds for promoting RES in the 
2014 – 2020 programming period, the Court makes the following 
recommendations:
Recommendation 1
The Commission, through guidance setting for programme and project 
preparation and selection as well as through conditions for making funding 
available for RES generation investments, should:
*	ensure that future Cohesion policy co-funded RES programmes are guided 
by the principle of cost-effectiveness, including the avoidance of 
deadweight. Programmes must be based on proper needs assessment, 
prioritisation of the most cost-effective technologies (while not discriminating 
between RES sectors) and optimal contribution to the EU RES 2020 target. 
Adequate RES generation objectives in relation to the budget as well as 
project selection criteria with a focus on the cost-effectiveness of the energy 
generation results (avoiding over-compensation of projects) need to be set; 
*	promote the establishment by the Member States of a stable and 
predictable regulatory framework for RES in general, along with smoother 
procedures for the integration of electricity from RES into the grid networks.
Recommendation 2
The Member States should establish and apply, based on Commission 
guidance, minimum cost-effectiveness criteria which are adapted to the 
projects’ circumstances. They should also enhance the added value of 
Cohesion policy funds by improving RES project implementation as well as 
monitoring and evaluation and by building a stock of measured data about 
energy generation costs in all relevant RES sectors.


INTRODUCTION
Renewable energy
1.	Energy from renewable sources (RES) is important for improving the 
security of energy supply in the EU and for reducing the EU’s dependence on 
conventional (fossil) fuels and imported energy, and for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. Electricity and heat can be generated from a range of 
resources, from the sun (concentrated solar power or photovoltaic power), wind 
(onshore or offshore), water (large, small or micro hydro), earth (geothermal for 
electricity or heat) and biomass (solid, liquid, landfill gas and biodegradable 
fraction of industrial and municipal waste, and liquid biofuels).
2.	RES also have an important role to play in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions and enhancing environmental sustainability. Moreover, the 
development of RES technologies has a potential to boost Europe’s economy, 
industrial competitiveness and employment. RES are expected to be 
economically competitive with conventional energy sources in the medium to 
long term .
3.	The development of renewable energy is laid out in the Article 194(1) of the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the context of the 
establishment and functioning of the internal market and the need to preserve 
and improve the environment.
EU Policy Objectives – the 2020 renewable energy target
4.	Already in 1997, the EU had declared a 12 % RES target by 2010. The 
Council of the European Union (the Council) set a binding EU target of 20 % in 
RES in gross final energy consumption by 2020, based on the Commission’s 
Renewable Energy Roadmap which lays down a pathway for mainstreaming 
RES into EU energy policies and markets (see Annex I concerning the national 
2020 RES targets)  . The Renewable Energy Directive adopted in 2009 
constitutes  a legally binding framework for the promotion of RES until 2020 :
*	Apart from setting the overall 20 % binding target for the EU and binding 
national targets of between 10 and 49 % by 2020 it improves the 
framework for promoting RES electricity (e.g. by introducing requirements 
for the Member States concerning access to the electricity grid and 
simplification of administrative procedures).
*	It required the Member States to develop national action plans that 
establish roadmaps for the development of RES and created cooperation 
mechanisms between the Member States to help achieve the RES target 
cost-effectively. 
5.	The Member States are required to ensure that their share of RES equals or 
exceeds indicative trajectories to reach the RES 2020 target. They must report 
every two years to the Commission on implementation of the Directive and 
progress towards their individual targets. RES measures are to be introduced in 
a cost-effective way . The Commission must produce, by 31 December 2014, a 
progress report on the implementation of the RES Directive . 
6.	In addition, the EU’s financial rules stipulate that the cost-effectiveness 
principle must be an important determinant of public spending decisions . 
Moreover, the European Parliament noted the need to identify the most cost-
effective RES and cost-optimal policies for realising the potential of RES . 
According to the Commission’s latest progress report  the EU’s RES 2020 
target will likely be exceeded as a whole, whereas not all Member States were 
on track in 2012 to reach their binding national targets, see Annex I. Following 
its Green Paper in 2013, the Commission laid out initial considerations for the 
Union’s climate and energy policy for the period from 2020 to 2030, proposing 
a binding EU target of 27 % for RES .
Barriers to renewable energy
7.	Apart from exogenous factors (such as evolution of energy prices or access 
to loans) multiple sector-specific obstacles hamper investments in RES 
throughout the Union and have not yet been eliminated by the Member States 
and the Commission :
*	Institutional and legal barriers, e.g. the priority given at EU level to energy 
issues is not always reflected at local, regional and national level whereby 
a lack of clear implementation strategies and flexibility in the relevant 
administrations or the national legal regimes as well as unclear legislative 
and contractual frameworks standing in the way of promoting RES; 
complex authorisation and permitting procedures for planning, building and 
operating RES installations together with environmental requirements 
discouraging project promoters to come up with feasible project proposals 
(lack of an effective administrative system)
*	Difficulties in integrating RES electricity in the transmission or distribution 
grids (technical problems, insufficient infrastructure, discriminatory 
practices preventing grid access, distribution of costs among the grid 
operators, government and project promoters and a lack of measuring of 
energy generation)
*	Non-stable or non-predictable promotion and incentive regimes and a lack 
of information for suppliers, customers and installers hampering the use of 
cost-effective technologies.
Financial Support for renewable energy by the Cohesion policy
8.	Cohesion policy instruments - the European Regional Development Fund 
(ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) - are the most important funding source 
among the EU spending programmes  for promoting renewable energy. While 
during the 2000-2006 programming period only 600 million euro had supported 
projects in this sector, approximately 4,7 billion euro was allocated to 
renewable energy in the 2007-2013 programming period, reflecting a much 
higher importance to this policy area (see Annex II for the breakdown by 
Member States). In the 2014-2020 programming period, Cohesion Policy 
support to the shift towards a low-carbon economy will further increase and 
may reach at least 27 billion euro from the ERDF . Further support can also be 
provided through the Cohesion Fund.
Box 1 – Cohesion policy spending for RES - key facts
270,8 billion euro - total ERDF / CF allocations for 2007–2013
0,6 billion euro - total ERDF / CF allocations to RES for 2000–2006
4,7 billion euro - total ERDF / CF allocations to RES for  2007–2013
at least 27 billion euro - estimated minimum ERDF allocations to supporting the shift 
towards a low-carbon economy, including RES, for 2014–2020. Further allocations 
could also be made from the Cohesion Fund (footnote 14)

Shared management
9.	In the framework of Cohesion policy the Member States draft the individual 
operational programmes, set up and operate their management and control 
systems and issue annual implementation reports to the Commission. 
Moreover, as part of the day-to-day management, national or regional bodies 
select the projects and are responsible for their implementation and evaluation. 
10.	Managing authorities, intermediate bodies and certifying authorities are in 
charge of managing the implementation of the operational programmes . 
Project funding is subject to rules and conditions laid down partly at EU  and 
partly at Member State level (project selection; project cost, benefit and 
earnings assessments; and also economic, social and environmental impact 
assessments are responsibilities of the Member States’ authorities).
11.	The Commission issues guidelines for drawing up operational programmes, 
approves the operational programmes and supervises the setting up and the 
operation of systems in the Member States. In particular, it monitors the 
implementation of the operational programmes essentially through the 
implementation reports received and through participation in monitoring 
committees. In addition to annual implementation reports, the Commission may 
request specific programme information and ‘project selection’ data from the 
managing authorities.
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
12.	The audit sought to answer the question whether the ERDF and CF projects 
investing in renewable energy generation had achieved good results. In this 
regard, multiple audit criteria were developed (see Annex IV) which were 
based on different sources and studies, including such by the Commission’s 
services. The Court examined whether the audited projects were implemented 
and delivered outputs as planned and whether they attained their energy 
generation targets. The audit analysed in particular whether the funds in the 
operational programmes in the 2007-2013 programming period had been 
allocated to well prioritised, cost-effective and mature renewable energy 
generation projects with rational objectives and the extent of the projects’ 
contribution in achieving the 2020 RES target. 
13.	The audit results were derived from an examination of 24 completed 
renewable energy generation projects from nine Operational Programmes 
financed through the ERDF or the CF in Austria, Finland, Malta, Poland and the 
United Kingdom . The projects were in the biomass, photovoltaic (PV), solar 
thermal and wind energy sectors . Annex III presents a list of the audited RES 
projects.
OBSERVATIONS
Audited projects delivering outputs as planned …
The overall picture is one of well-planned projects delivering according to 
plan
14.	The audited RES projects were sufficiently mature and ready for 
implementation when selected. In spite of relatively long preparatory phases in 
some of the biomass and wind energy projects critical permits, licences and 
technical plans had usually been obtained prior to project approval. Where 
applicable, it was also ensured that the installations were connected to the 
transmission or distribution networks or that contracts were concluded with a 
sufficient number of consumers .
15.	There have been no significant cost overruns or time delays in the projects. 
Overall, the audited RES projects were implemented within the planned time 
schedules or with only relatively small time slippages (implementation was 
delayed by more than 6 months only in two projects of which one was due to 
repair downtime of a small combined heat and power plant). No significant cost 
overruns occurred during implementation. Box 2 shows examples of audited 
RES projects.

16.	With the exception of one biomass facility , the RES generation capacities 
were installed and operational as planned. No major risks to their technical 
sustainability were apparent. Few deviations from initial planning and approved 
project proposals were found. The projects’ installed energy generation 
capacities were generally in line with the co-financing decisions. The facilities 
have been in operation without major technical or other problems since their 
commissioning. Only a few generation units from the audited projects were not 
in operation mode. Operators had in place sufficient expertise and resources to 
ensure a smooth running and regular maintenance of their installations.

Biomass
Three audited biomass heating plants (capacity from 3 MW to 8 MW) with district 
heating network lines (of 0,6 to 11 km) were constructed in Austria. The plants 
supplied heat and hot water for a total 266 consumers (private individuals or industrial 
companies).
Three audited projects in Finland related to the construction of new biomass-pellet or 
wood chips boilers (capacity from 0,8 MW to 2,5 MW). They replaced old fossil fuel 
(heavy oil) boilers. Two of these projects included also construction of the required 
district heating network (0,6 and 3 km).
Wind power
Five wind farms with power capacities ranging from 3,2 to 38 MW were constructed in 
Poland. The facilities include all necessary infrastructures (high/medium voltage 
substations, connections to electricity grid and service roads).
Solar power (PV and solar collectors)
Two projects installed PV electricity systems with associated hardware and monitoring 
systems on public buildings in Malta. One project was complemented by a small wind 
turbine.
Five similar projects in Poland installed individual sets of flat plate solar collectors for 
households and public buildings in five municipalities to supply residents with hot 
water. In total, over 3 000 public and private beneficiaries installed solar collectors. 
One project included street lighting and PV.

… but encountering some difficulties in implementation
There is scope for further improvement at all project stages - from 
procurement through operations to monitoring and evaluation
17.	Difficulties with RES electricity integration into the grid have hampered 
exploitation of RES. Throughout the EU the development of the grid has been 
identified as one of the key barriers to the large-scale integration of RES 
electricity into the transmission and distribution grids . Accordingly, the Union 
and its Member States need to invest in both national networks and cross-
border links as part of building the internal energy market. The owners of the 
projects audited emphasised that spare capacity in the grids was insufficient , 
the grids have to be expanded and modernised and greater transparency about 
the distribution of costs among the grid operators, government and project 
promoters could improve system-wide efficiency. While only few of the audited 
projects encountered grid connection problems, the deployment of RES 
generation is, nonetheless, not accompanied by improved grids in the Member 
States. Technical and cost issues were frequently cited by national authorities 
and RES operators as impediments to an effective RES integration to the grids. 
Box 3 illustrates problems in connection with RES electricity in the grids.

Box 3 - Access to the grid of RES electricity in Poland, integration of electricity 
from photovoltaic  into the grid in Malta
The poor state and lack of spare capacity of the transmission and distribution grids 
have been key barriers to the further integration of electricity from PV and wind energy 
in Poland. Apart from the need for expansion and modernisation of grid infrastructure, 
complications with obtaining the necessary permits for grid connection (legal and 
technical problems as well as grid connection fees) hampered RES development . In 
the audited wind energy projects, the lead times to construction of the facilities, 
including for the required grid connection permits, have been 4 to 5 years.
Clear guidelines about planning permission and permits, where required, were 
available concerning solar and PV installations in Malta. However, in 2010 and 2011 
when multiple EU co-funded projects were commissioned these frequently 
encountered difficulties with feeding-in of their generated electricity - usually the 
electricity in excess of producers’ own consumption. Since meters had not been 
installed by the grid operator the producers were not compensated for their electricity 
by the feed-in tariff for periods of up to 4 months.
18.	The Commission in its analysis of Member States’ 2011 renewable energy 
progress reports indicated that progress removing the administrative barriers 
was still slow, with complex and discouraging authorisation and permitting 
procedures . There is potential for improvements in the Member States where 
the audit took place. The audit found, for example, that Malta had embarked on 
RES development only during the 2007-2013 period whereby a market for RES 
has not yet developed to maturity. An effective administrative system has not 
developed in full yet. Moreover, in Poland and in the United Kingdom national 
or regional harmonised approaches to coordinate the work of the authorities 
were partially lacking. Notably measuring and reporting of projects’ energy 
results were poor and hence data was not used for comparing projects and 
different RES sectors as a useful information in designing future measures.
19.	However, a good practice example was found in Austria. A quality 
management tool for biomass heating plants assured proper monitoring 
arrangements in this Member State (‘QM Heizwerke’, see Box 4).
Box 4 - Project monitoring in Austria
All biomass district heating plants larger than 400 kW and/or feeding a heating network 
larger than 1 km are obliged to carry out an accompanying quality management. 
Coordination of the funding process and the management of the necessary planning 
and operating data is facilitated through a database which provides a standard 
platform for project beneficiaries, as well as technical and economic data for quality 
managers and an IT platform for monitoring and optimisation of the operations. 
Introduced in 2006, ‘QM Heizwerke’ contains data from over 100 biomass plants.

20.	The procurement processes did not ensure full transparency, fairness or 
efficiency in contractors’ selection:
-	The tenders had to be cancelled in two audited PV projects in Malta 
because all bids had been technically or administratively non-compliant. 
This was due to either unnecessarily high technical requirements or overly 
complex procedures and requirements. In both cases some delay occurred 
and competition among bidders was hampered.
-	In two projects in Poland, the wind turbine models were specified 
unnecessarily in construction plans or construction permits. This prevented 
tender specifications which could ensure competitive procurement and best 
price/quality ratios. In another project, likewise, a specific solar collector 
type had been pre-determined. In each of those tenders only one bid of 
those submitted met the technical specifications.
-	Implementing bodies and project beneficiaries lacked sufficient expertise 
on RES technologies, their markets and procurement frameworks. Multiple 
RES equipment and installation works have been of a similar, sometimes 
identical, nature and small in size, especially the operations under grant 
schemes. Therefore, conditions were there for a coordinated procurement 
managed by a specialised unit of experts at national/regional level to obtain 
better price/quality ratios, economies of scale and also shorter 
procurement periods. Examples are roof top water heating systems, PV 
panels and small biomass in Malta and Poland. There were temporary 
suspensions of projects in Malta, partly, as a result of non-efficient 
organisation of procurement.

21.	The preparation of the RES projects has been insufficient for effective 
monitoring and evaluation. The objectives and performance indicators set in all 
operational programmes audited were imprecise and not based on reliable 
baseline data. Thus, the projects in the same or different RES sectors could not 
be compared; nor could the contribution of the EU funds to the EU and national 
RES targets be verified by the competent authorities (see also paragraph 30). 
… and results not properly measured or projects not attaining their 
energy generation targets in the majority of cases
RES data collection and reporting can be improved 
22.	No accurate, validated data about actual RES project results is available in 
the Member States. The RES sector was characterised by enormous volatility 
in terms of the costs of the technologies (most technologies saw massive price 
reductions) and increasing energy prices. It is important to analyse up-to-date 
information about RES technology costs in order to establish which 
technologies render the most favourable yields in the specific local 
circumstances and the appropriate levels of support. 
23.	However, while data is available about the projects’ installed generation 
capacities, no or non-reliable data was available on the actual generated 
energy in 11 out of 24 audited projects. Actual measurement and reporting not 
having been conditions for public co-financing, project final reports provided 
only estimated, non-measured results - usually based on technical parameters 
of the RES technologies as supplied by the manufacturers and the specific 
local situations. Multiple RES producers did not measure their energy yields. 
Thus, in 11 of 24 audited projects (five in Poland - solar projects in the Lublin 
region, four in Malta and two in the United Kingdom) the energy results were 
not based on measured / validated data but on assumed values taken from 
literature or professional estimates made by engineers.
Project results not always achieved
24.	Of 13 out of the 24 audited projects, in which energy generation results 
were actually measured, the targets were attained in only 5 projects, and 
almost attained in 3 further projects. The remaining projects did not reach or 
only partly reached their production targets. While in several cases this was 
due to insufficiently precise forecasts some projects had also encountered 
technical problems in their initial stages. Table 1 compares the RES projects’ 
planned with actual energy generation.

audited RES projects with measured energy generation results,  
2009-2012, in %
  
Source: Court’s own calculations based on ‘QM Heizwerke’ database (Austria), information about average 
investment costs of similar projects (Finland and Poland); project financing agreements, information about 
project results calculated by beneficiaries.
25.	In summary, the evaluation of the 24 audited projects’ cost-effectiveness, 
implementation and achievement of objectives has resulted in a mixed bag of 
good, satisfactory and poor projects, as is laid out in Annex IV. Box 5 indicates 
reasons for weak performance in some RES projects.
Box 5 – Reasons for weak project performance
In Austria, actual energy generation was in line with or above forecasts in those project 
stages which were directly supported by ERDF funds. However, in two projects which 
were later extended by additional heat capacity and networks serving additional 
customers the planned targets were not achieved. The main causes were 
overestimated heat demand or non-consumption of heat, temporarily, by major 
customers.
The reasons for a lower than anticipated performance in the Polish wind energy 
projects were too optimistic wind forecasts and technical problems during the first year 
of operation.
In the United Kingdom, moreover, although final data was not available and the 
audited grant schemes were not completed at the time of the audit, the results of sub-
projects revealed nonetheless that some of them did not attain their planned energy 
generation targets - mainly due to high water contents in the biomass materials or 
lower energy demand than estimated. 
The principle of cost effectiveness is not fully considered in planning the 
RES projects
Cost-effectiveness - an important objective in EU spending
26.	Cost-effectiveness concerns the ability or potential of an audited entity, 
activity, programme or operation to achieve certain outcomes at a reasonable 
cost. Cost-effectiveness analyses are studies of the relationship between 
project cost and outcomes, expressed as cost per unit of outcome achieved . 
27.	Optimal (or cost-effective) RES energy generation is important for economic 
performance. Cohesion policy funds constitute a significant part of support for 
RES activities and could be an important driver of both RES policy as well as 
regional economic development. 
  
Picture 6 - Windmill (outside and interior views of a wind turbine in Poland)

There is scope for an emphasis on cost-effectiveness at an early stage 
28.	In connection with the preparation of the operational programmes, the 
national authorities did not conduct proper needs assessments to identify which 
technologies could contribute to attaining the RES targets in the most cost-
effective way and how they could be complemented by other financial 
instruments or national support schemes. As a result, the operational 
programmes did not contain explanations how the EU funds could contribute 
cost-effectively to attaining the RES objectives. 
29.	Moreover, the Commission and the national authorities did not plan the 
Cohesion policy (or national) funds’ contributions in attaining the RES targets. 
From the audited operational programmes, those in Austria and in Finland did 
not lay out the planned and actual RES energy generated from the ERDF and 
CF supported measures. The installed capacity from RES in the five audited 
countries to meet the RES target in 2020 is 95 304 MW (see Table 2). The 
implementation reports submitted by the managing authorities to the 
Commission reveal that, by 2012, 4 464 MW or 4,7 % of the required capacity 
as per the 2020 target (or 8,1 % in relation to the 2013 trajectory target in the 
audited Member States) was contributed through the Cohesion policy projects 
in these countries. The Cohesion policy funds’ use for RES has been variable 
among the Member States. As can also be seen from Table 2, for multiple 
Member States no adequate data is available for comparing the achievement of 
the Cohesion policy projects in relation to the RES targets. This lack of data 
inhibits establishing baseline economic and energy data in different RES 
sectors and for different RES technologies.

nature of investments (energy generation, RES promotion, networks, pilot projects, etc.).

operational programmes for 2012.
30.	The cost-effectiveness of measures in different RES sectors was not 
examined and did not determine the budgets earmarked to RES under the 
audited operational programmes while proper needs assessment and mid-term 
evaluations were lacking:
-	When operational programmes were designed in 2007 there had been a 
lack of detailed situation analysis (including needs assessment in different 
RES sectors in the regions); in particular, the costs per unit of energy 
capacity installed or the costs of energy generation per unit had not been 
estimated by national authorities thus neglecting the cost-benefit / cost-
effectiveness of the measures planned to be financed through public 
means;
-	Also, the operational programmes did not take advantage of the results of 
or lessons learnt from previous RES programmes financed by national or 
EU resources;
-	No adequate justification for allocating public funds to RES generation 
interventions was provided. Fund allocations were, in general, based on 
rough estimation of the regional potential and fund absorption capacities 
rather than systematic analysis of the regional situation and comparison 
between potential alternatives in terms of types of RES or RES 
technologies;
-	Although the authorities in Finland and in the United Kingdom inserted 
some adaptations in their programmes along the way without formal 
assessments, in general however no mid-term evaluations or similar 
assessments of the 2007-2013 measures were conducted which could 
have helped redirect the RES programmes.
31.	Furthermore, the operational programmes failed to establish performance 
indicators for proper monitoring and evaluation of cost-effectiveness of RES 
measures which could also have facilitated assessing the contribution of the 
EU funds to the committed RES targets (Table 2). While the operational 
programmes in Austria, Poland and Malta had indicators referring to additional 
RES capacity, the set of result indicators in Finland did not include indicators 
for creation of generation capacity, produced energy or reduction/avoidance of 
CO2 emissions, and in the United Kingdom a result indicator in respect of RES 
capacity creation was also lacking. This means that, in these cases, the 
managing authorities and the Commission were not in a position to conduct 
adequate monitoring and ex-post evaluation of the Cohesion policy funds’ 
investments in RES .

… and there is also scope for more cost-effective RES generation 
projects
32.	Removing inefficiencies in the planning and implementation of RES projects 
will make a direct contribution to achieving the 2020 EU and national RES 
targets. But it can also benefit the energy consumers and boost the broader 
economy as well. 
33.	The results of the EU-supported projects varied in terms of their cost-
effectiveness. The investment costs of RES technologies range widely and are 
site specific. There is no single most cost-effective RES generation technology 
in the EU. Therefore the audit compared only costs within a particular RES 
sector in the same Member State. Four audited projects were significantly more 
expensive than similar projects in the same Member State (biomass and PV 
projects, see Table 3). The calculated average costs for installed capacity 
varied from 0,16 million EUR/MW to 1,8 million EUR/ MW in the audited 
projects. As calculated by the national authorities in one of the Member States 
where the audit took place, the payback periods varied from 2 to 537 years in 
the audited projects. Capital-intensive investments with payback periods of 
more than 100 years will not achieve an economically reasonable break-even 
point. This indicates that public support was not always allocated to the most 
cost-effective projects. 

Table 3 - Cost-effectiveness of the audited RES projects

authorities1.
1 Note to FI projects: Average machinery and equipment investment costs of the audited 
projects. Project 5 includes piping costs on the site, Project 6 auxiliary boiler only. Data not 
available for projects MT 23 and 24 (PV), PL 16 to 20 (solar energy) as well as UK 9 and 10 
(biomass).
34.	Rational energy objectives were only partly set for the RES projects. The 
projects were in line with national strategic RES objectives. Fuel supply 
concepts existed where necessary (biomass projects in Austria, Finland and in 
the United Kingdom). Some projects were preceded by limited studies showing 
their economic viability and profitability but no analyses were made concerning 
the best and most cost-effective RES types and best technological solutions. 
Evaluations of previous similar interventions were not referred and thus no 
‘lessons learnt’ were used in preparing the audited RES projects.
35.	Only about half of the audited projects (13 of 24) had data through which 
the achievement of the indicators in terms of actually achieved energy 
generation could be verified (Table 1 and Annex III), see also paragraph 24. 
Furthermore, frequently baseline data about the costs of energy production, the 
quantities of conventional fuels used by consumers was not available before 
objective-setting and designing the projects (e.g. operational programme of the 
Lublin region in Poland). Consequently, in such cases, it is not possible to 
assess whether the funded projects actually generated the expected economic 
or financial results (e.g. for calculating payback periods).
36.	The selection procedures did not guarantee cost-effective projects. In 
general, the project selection criteria, approved by the monitoring committees 
established for each operational programme, were not enabling the 
implementing authorities to identify the most cost-effective RES projects. The 
creation of energy capacity, actual energy generation and the relevant 
necessary investments were in many cases not weighted as selection or award 
criteria. In a few cases, no specific selection criteria in relation to RES 
generation had been developed but instead selection criteria universally 
applicable to multiple sectors covered by the operational programme were 
used . 
37.	There has been insufficient competition among project applications in some 
cases. Where the projects were identified through calls for proposals maximum 
cost-effectiveness of applications (payback period, investment to energy 
generation ratio) was not considered. Whereas usually project applications had 
to fulfil minimum criteria, the processes could not prevent subsidising relatively 
low quality projects in terms of their energy generation results. A determined 
minimum investment size risked that applications for smaller projects - possibly 
having better economic parameters - were discarded.
38.	On the other hand, Austria, the United Kingdom and to some extent Finland 
had technical and economic criteria in the financing rules geared towards 
preventing wasteful biomass projects to be selected. There was therefore less 
risk of selecting non-effective applications. Also, project profitability was taken 
into account whereby more profitable projects received less subsidies (Box 6). 
Such adaptation of the level of project co-financing was not ensured by the 
competent authorities in the other Member States where the audit took place. 
Box 6 – Project selection – cases in Austria, Finland and the United Kingdom
In Austria,  when applying for co-funding certain technical and economic criteria have 
to be met (heat density per running meter of the district heating pipe, district heating 
and boiler’s efficiency). As a result, there is much less risk that non-effective projects 
are supported.
In Finland, the eligibility criteria and possibility to have consultation with energy 
consultant/advisor intend to eliminate non-commercially viable projects: the project 
applicants were required to provide information about the payback-period of the 
applied project, which should not be less than 3 years (commercially profitable) nor 
longer than 12 years (uneconomic), without the public aid.
In the United Kingdom, the proposed project costs were compared with target costs 
based on past similar biomass projects.
39.	The EU co-financing rates varied between 2 % and 85 % in the operational 
programmes, without this being justified in the relevant documents. The co-
financing principle holds that part of the investment costs of a project is borne 
by the final recipient of a public grant whereby the revenue or profitability in the 
project are to be taken into account. The purpose of the grant should, 
furthermore, be to support an action which could not otherwise take off due to a 
financing gap or a lack of an economic incentive. There is an opportunity cost; 
high co-financing rates reduced the size or number of other RES projects which 
could have been supported through public funds. No links were made between 
rate of support and profitability or need for incentivising investors to carry out 
RES generation projects. Non-justified very high co-financing rates (public 
financial support to an amount higher than necessary for a project to be 
economically or financially viable) increased the risk of deadweight - i.e. 
replacing private funds, but also national funds - and reduced the number of 
supported RES generation projects. Box 7 illustrates cases of high co-
financing.
Box 7 – High public co-financing – cases in Poland and Malta
In Poland, the schemes for small PV and solar were allocated 85 % from EU funds, 
whereby individual project owners (households) could receive up to 100 % subsidy. 
Most large wind farms received maximum public support – either close to 70 % of total 
eligible investment costs or 10 million euro (4 of the 5 audited projects). While the 
maximum co-financing rates were applied in most cases they were, however, not 
modulated or justified based on cost-effectiveness considerations in any programming 
document. Four of five wind power project beneficiaries recognised that they could 
have implemented the projects without or with reduced grants and intended to use the 
EU grants for early repayment of loans.
Malta devoted a large part of available EU funding for supporting RES installations of 
public institutions thereby not sufficiently leveraging private funding sources. As a rule, 
the EU financed as much as 85 % of investment costs in those projects. Two large 
grant schemes, furthermore, for private households and enterprises financed RES 
installations by 50 % or 60 % respectively.
40.	Profitability calculations were not made for different RES sectors or 
technologies. When planning the programmes the co-financing rates did not 
distinguish between the RES sectors, size and types of investments, other 
promotion / support regimes in the Member States (feed-in tariffs, premiums), 
likely profitability of the investments and the type of RES technologies used.

Cohesion policy funds having limited EU added value - the RES projects 
did not make their full contribution to the EU’s energy objectives 
41.	In only a few cases was  significant EU added value demonstrated. In those 
projects the ERDF / CF co-financing facilitated the cap-funding, the co-
financing has been a welcome additional source of investment and thus 
contributed to the implementation of the projects. For the (larger) wind farms it 
was also regarded as a quality stamp for third-party financing institutions. It is 
clear that in countries with low RES penetration, which had few RES 
programmes and less administrative experience in this sector, the EU funds 
have had more value added in that they have helped to develop additional 
economic development, increase the quality of the relevant projects and also, 
to some extent, through acting as a catalyst and for leveraging other funds. 
Moreover, there has been an ‘operational value added’ to some extent as the 
EU projects imposed certain obligations on the implementing bodies through 
which some learning effects were assured for the organisations involved. 
Those effects were emphasised notably by organisations in Malta, Poland and 
the United Kingdom.
42.	The Court also found that the RES allocations within the operational 
programmes in Austria and Finland were prone to a risk of replacing national 
funds. Indeed, in both these countries the ERDF merely complemented existing 
national / regional funding mechanisms and in Austria the EU support was 
virtually integrated, without changing anything else, into an existing subsidy 
scheme for biomass plants. Austria and Finland have a long-lasting tradition of 
RES (especially in the hydro energy and biomass areas) and it is difficult to 
assess whether the EU funds contributed to additional value added, particularly 
in regard to innovation. 
43.	In 2012, the Commission stressed that Member States and regions need to 
ensure that funding for RES complements private investment, leveraging it, and 
not crowding it out . The Court found that some RES projects could have been 
implemented without public support. It was evident that multiple project 
applicants could have set up the RES installations without or with smaller public 
grants thus freeing up money for additional RES measures. However, the grant 
decisions were nonetheless important in view of bankable project financing: 
-	The Austrian projects in question were all endorsed after completion of the 
construction works signalling that the subsidy was not a condition for 
investment. 
-	Four of the five audited projects in Finland could have been realised 
without subsidies (only one project would not have been implemented 
without support by public funds).  
-	Several wind energy project owners said they would have carried out their 
projects without public subsidies as the economic incentive through the 
wind yields and the ‘green certificates’ had been sufficient. Indeed, multiple 
existing similar wind farms had been constructed without being subsidised. 
44.	The RES investments had only a limited effect on building managerial 
capacities. One of the intended effects of EU added value is improved 
administrative or managerial capacities in the Member States. Albeit various 
stakeholders in Malta, Poland and the United Kingdom claimed there had been 
invaluable learning effects from the EU projects, in general no far-reaching 
contributions to improving project planning, implementation and operation could 
be demonstrated. The RES grant schemes and individual projects were 
generally managed with a focus on regularity issues without addressing value 
for money requirements. In Austria and Finland, the EU co-financing was 
merely made part of the national support mechanisms without particular 
innovation aspects (see as well paragraph 42). The experience gained during 
the implementation of the projects was not disseminated in these two Member 
States or neighbouring regions.
45.	The RES projects were often operating in fragile regulatory environments. 
Although the EU funds devoted to RES generation were indeed not aimed at 
reforming regulatory frameworks, they could nevertheless have triggered 
improvements to those. The RES legal frameworks in many Member States 
have suffered multiple revisions, including retroactive changes in the subsidy 
and promotion regimes. Permitting procedures are often complex and 
discouraging or not applied consistently and, together with market uncertainty 
and volatility in energy prices, jeopardise investor confidence in the sector.
46.	There has been variable but overall low use of Cohesion funds for RES in 
the Member States. Although the EU funds allocated to RES increased from 
0,6 in the 2000-2006 programming period to 4,7 billion euro in the 2007-13 
programming period, this represents only 1,7 % of total ERDF and CF 
spending. In relation to the enormous investment needs in the sector for 
reaching the EU 2020 RES target the allocation of EU funds by the national 
and regional authorities was low . The Member States allocated between 0 % 
(the lowest value) and 10,7 % (the highest value) of total ERDF and CF funds. 
Even the 10 % allocated by Malta for RES is not significant to reaching its 
national RES target of 10 % by 2020 when considering that the country had 
practically no RES in 2007 and attained less than 2 % of RES in final energy 
consumption by 2012 (see Annex I). Of the Member States covered by the 
audit, Malta had failed to reach the first mid-term objective and Austria, Finland 
and Poland had not transposed the RES Directive in national legislation by the 
end of October 2013 (the deadline was 5 December 2010). 
47.	The uptake of the funds allocated to RES has been slow. By the end of 
2012 , the absorption of the available ERDF and CF funds for RES for 2007-
2013 (only 58 %) has been much lower than the average for the total ERDF 
and CF funds (88 %) and also lower than for energy efficiency measures 
(84 %). Although the market failures and barriers are of different nature in this 
sector the EU co-financed projects in almost all Member States have been 
managed by the same managing authorities, see Table 4. Relatively high 
complexity of the RES projects and a lack of administrative capacity to manage 
investment measures in this sector, clearly, had an impact on the lower ERDF 
and CF disbursement rates. Thus, overall, the Cohesion funds were of a 
modest significance for achieving the EU RES target.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
48.	Overall, the Court concludes that value for money of Cohesion policy funds 
support to RES generation projects has been limited in helping achieve the EU 
RES 2020 target. 
49.	The audited projects delivered outputs as planned: Most of the audited RES 
projects were sufficiently mature and ready for implementation when selected, 
there have been no major cost overruns and time delays in the projects and the 
RES generation capacities, generally, were installed as planned (paragraphs 
14 to 16). 
50.	However, the Court found also that there were weaknesses in 
implementation: In particular concerning performance indicators, measuring 
and reporting of project results as well as procurement procedures and 
outcomes. In general, difficulties of integrating RES electricity into the grids 
have been identified as a major impediment to the development of RES in the 
EU (paragraphs 17 to 21).
51.	Moreover, the energy generation targets were not achieved or the results 
not properly measured in around two thirds of the audited RES projects. In 
most of these cases, insufficient or non-measured data about actual generated 
energy was available. The non-achievement of planned results was mostly due 
to imprecise forecasts or technical problems. Overall, the project outcomes 
have been mixed (paragraphs 22 to 25). 
52.	Furthermore, cost-effectiveness has not been the guiding principle in 
planning the projects. The underlying operational programmes were designed 
without prioritisation of the RES sectors and without assessments of the funds’ 
contributions to the RES objectives. Fund allocations were, in general, based 
on rough estimation of the regional potential and fund absorption capacities 
rather than systematic analysis of the regional situation and comparison 
between potential alternatives in terms of types of RES or RES technologies. 
The cost-effectiveness of the measures was neglected when they were 
allocated the budgets. Rational energy objectives and performance indicators 
for energy generation had not been set well in all projects. The selection criteria 
and procedures were frequently not conducive to selecting the most cost-
effective RES projects. Project results were mixed in regard of cost-
effectiveness whereby in some Member States the high co-financing rates were 
not justified in the documents in relation to the projects’ profitability (paragraphs 
26 to 40).
53.	The audit also found that the Cohesion policy funds for RES had a limited 
EU added value. There has been a risk of public funding replacement in those 
Member States which simply used the EU funds to complement their national 
grants for RES as well as a risk of deadweight. While the EU co-financing had 
some ‘operational value added’ the investment projects have not, however, 
helped build up managerial capacities in a significant way. Overall the use of 
ERDF and CF for RES has been modest in relation to the need for increased 
efforts to reach the EU objectives (paragraphs 41 to 47).
54.	The Court emphasises the need for improvements if Cohesion policy 
funding is to make the maximum possible contribution to achieving the energy 
targets . Furthermore, Cohesion policy spending, in general, brings benefits to 
the broader economy, including economic growth and job creation which are 
overarching aims of Cohesion policy. In view of a likely enhanced use of EU 
funds for promoting RES in the 2014–2020 programming period, the Court 
makes the following recommendations:

Recommendation 1
The Commission, through guidance setting for programme and project 
preparation and selection as well as through conditions for making funding 
available for RES generation investments, should:
*	ensure that future Cohesion policy co-funded RES programmes are guided 
by the principle of cost-effectiveness, including EU funding support to cost-
effective programmes that would not otherwise take place, so as to avoid 
deadweight. Programmes must be based on proper needs assessment, 
prioritisation of the most cost-effective technologies (while not 
discriminating between RES sectors) and optimal contribution to the EU 
2020 target. Adequate RES generation objectives in relation to the budget 
as well as projects selection criteria with a focus on the cost-effectiveness 
of the energy generation results (avoiding over-compensation of projects) 
need to be set;
*	promote the establishment by the Member States of a stable and 
predictable regulatory framework for RES in general, along with smoother 
procedures for the integration of electricity from RES into the grid networks.

Recommendation 2
The Member States should establish and apply, based on Commission 
guidance, minimum cost-effectiveness criteria which are adapted to the 
projects’ circumstances. They should also enhance the added value of 
Cohesion policy funds by improving RES project implementation as well as 
monitoring and evaluation and by building a stock of measured data about 
energy generation costs in all relevant RES sectors.

 	Of the 24 audited projects, 9 were for electricity production from full-scale or 
micro-wind turbines or photovoltaic panels, 15 projects related to heat generation 
from biomass or hot water production from solar collectors. The size of the 
projects varied from household-scale single solar panel projects to a wind farm 
with 16 turbines.
 	For instance, the approval of the audited biomass projects in Austria was 
conditional on a sufficient number of consumers of the produced heat energy.
 	One biomass power plant in Austria deviated from original plan in that it utilised 
EU funds for heat network extension instead of installing a second boiler as per 
original plan. This deviation was in anticipation of an extension of heating capacity 
to serve additional heat consumers and is therefore not a shortcoming from a 
sound financial management point of view.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	The Design Studies (DS) and Construction of New Infrastructures (CNI) 
support schemes form part of the EU policy on the development of high-
level 
research infrastructures of a European dimension. The contribution to 
projects 
under the 6th Framework Programme (FP6) for Research (2002-2006) 
amounted to 140 million euro.
II.	The audit examined whether the two schemes had promoted the 
development of a fabric of research infrastructures of the highest 
quality and 
performance in Europe, and their optimum use on a European scale based on 
the needs expressed by the research community. The audit analysed in 
particular, if the DS scheme had been useful to decision makers and if 
the CNI 
scheme had resulted in the construction of new infrastructures. Attention 
was 
also given to actions taken to encourage the use of complementary funding 
for 
research facilities.
III.	The Court concluded that: 
-	the DS scheme was positively viewed by the representatives of the 
research community interviewed, providing in their view, critical early 
stage 
funding for infrastructure development and encouraging collaboration 
amongst would be competitors in the European research field; and
-	Community support for the construction of new infrastructures had a 
limited 
impact on the emergence of a fabric of research facilities in Europe. The 
CNI scheme had little catalysing effect and, although the payment of CNI 
support led to some technical upgrading of the investment projects 
concerned, most projects supported would have gone ahead with or 
without Community support;
-	the Commissionâ€™s services did not actively promote the use of 
different 
funding sources available for research infrastructures in Europe despite 
advocating such use in various official pronouncements. 
IV.	The Court recommends that the Commission should reconsider whether 
CNI projects should be funded from the research budget given the findings 
concerning European added value. Furthermore, scheme objectives should be 
clear and realistic. The Commission should consider what is to be 
achieved 
through the use of complementary funding sources and if it believes that 
synergies can be obtained to make better use of EU funds, it should take 
the 
necessary actions. 


INTRODUCTION
1.	This report covers EU expenditure on Design Studies (DS) and 
Construction of New Infrastructures (CNI) support schemes under the 
Research Infrastructures (RI) activity area of the 6th Framework 
Programme 
(FP6) for Research (2002-2006). 
2.	The term â€œresearch infrastructuresâ€ refers to facilities and 
resources 
providing essential services to the research community in academic and/or 
industrial areas. The infrastructure may take the form of a single 
resource at a 
single location, a network of distributed resources or even be â€œvirtualâ€, 
with the 
service being provided electronically .
EU research budget co-finances research infrastructures
3.	Community Research and Technological Development (RTD) activities 
have been financed since 1984 through multiannual framework programmes, 
which set out the scientific and technological objectives to be followed 
for a 
programming period. Specific support for research facilities started with 
the 2nd 
Framework Programme (FP2) (1987-1991). The initial aim was to improve 
access for the scientific community to national research infrastructures 
but this 
was subsequently broadened to also include support for cooperation 
networks 
and for research activities to improve the quality and quantity of 
services 
provided by the infrastructures as well as for the development of new 
scientific 
equipment . Since FP2, financial support has increased considerably (see 
Figure 1).

4.	The overall objective of the RI activity area of FP6 was to promote 
the 
development in Europe of a â€fabric of research infrastructures of the 
highest 
quality and performanceâ€. This was to be based upon the needs expressed 
by 
the research community and with â€œEuropean Added Valueâ€ being created 
through the extension of the use of such infrastructures throughout 
Europe.
5.	According to a Commission analysis carried out in 2000 the 
development of 
state-of-the-art research facilities in Europe was hampered by:
-	a lack of coordinated mechanisms for needs assessment and setting of 
priorities across countries and disciplines; 
-	a lack of a coherent, European position on the participation in 
world-scale 
undertakings;
-	the difficulty to establish multinational funding agreements;
-	obstacles to transnational access to facilities; and
-	a low level of coordination among infrastructure operators and the 
consequent lack of critical mass in the technological development related 
to infrastructures .
6.	To help resolve known difficulties in the setting up of new research 
facilities 
the Commission proposed for FP6 an approach centred on support for large 
scale research facilities in Europe. Five support schemes were defined 
covering:
-	Transnational Access,
-	Integrating Activities,
-	Communication Network Development,
-	Design Studies, 
-	Construction of New Infrastructures.
7.	For FP6, a budget of 140 million of the 715 million euro available 
for 
infrastructure support was allocated to the DS and CNI support schemes 
(see 
the overview in Figure 2). 


Figure 2 - â€œDesign Studiesâ€ and â€œConstruction of New Infrastructuresâ€ 
schemes 
in FP6
 
Design Studies
8.	Design studies projects are intended to test the feasibility of 
potential future 
research facilities (including the development of new equipment). The DS 
scheme was to support feasibility studies and technical preparatory work 
for 
new infrastructures which were to have a clear European dimension and 
interest. Support could also be given to facilities of world-wide 
relevance 
located outside Europe but in which European organisations intended to 
participate.
9.	The DS projects audited by the Court (see Annex I) deal with topics 
such 
as free electron light sources, accelerator/colliders, large optical and 
infrared 
telescopes and the construction of aquaculture centres. An example of a 
design study can be found in Textbox 1.
Textbox 1 - The SKADS project
One of the objectives of the â€˜Square Kilometre Array Design Studyâ€™ 
(SKADS) was to 
develop cost-effective technology for future radio astronomy. The total 
amount of EU 
financial support was 10,4 million euro, approximately one third of the 
total cost of the 
project. The grant contractor, SKADS consortium, was composed of 26 
participants 
from nine EU Member States, South Africa, Canada, Australia and Russia. 
This design study confirmed that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a 
giant 
radiotelescope distributed over several continents, could be built using 
simpler and 
cheaper structures than the hundreds of conventional dish antennae 
originally 
foreseen. 
Subsequently the SKA project was included in the â€˜European Roadmap for 
Research 
Infrastructuresâ€™ (see paragraphs 16 and 17). Its Phase 1 construction is 
planned for 
2012-2016.

Construction of New Infrastructures
10.	The objective of the CNI scheme was to support the development of new 
or 
enhanced infrastructures. As with Design Studies, support could also be 
given 
to facilities of world-wide relevance located outside Europe but in which 
European organisations intended to participate. Eligible projects could 
take the 
form of traditional buildings but could also include for example a system 
of 
antennae in the Atacama desert in Chile or a virtual infrastructure, such 
as a 
distributed digitised archive to improve linguistic research (see Annex 
II for CNI 
projects audited). An example of a CNI project is given in Textbox 2.
Textbox 2 - CeMaCE project
The TjÃ¤rnÃ¶ Marine Biological Laboratory (TMBL) is a marine biology field 
station in 
Sweden. Together with Akademiska Hus, Swedenâ€™s main owner of university 
property, 
the TMBL is building the Centre for Marine Chemical Ecology (CeMaCE). 
This 
multidisciplinary facility will provide European researchers with access 
to laboratories, 
equipment and scientific expertise. The Centre, with a direct access to 
the sea from 
the banks of Koster fjord, integrates molecular biology, ecology and 
evolutionary 
biology â€“ a combination that should provide an innovative approach to 
marine 
ecological chemistry. 
The European financial support for this project, amounting to over 900 
000 euro, was 
mainly used for the construction of a marine ecotron â€“ a facility 
offering ecologically 
relevant experimental conditions with control of several environmental 
factors â€“ and 
contributes to the creation of marine ecology laboratories. The overall 
costs of the 
project amounted to 9 million euro.
Selection of projects
11.	DS and CNI projects under FP6 were selected following a call for 
proposals 
published in November 2003 . The maximum rate of co-financing for DS and 
CNI projects under FP6 was 50 % and 10 % respectively. The call was open 
to 
projects in any field of science and technology and the Commission 
received 
121 proposals, in total amounting to 387 million euro. As the Commission, 
in 
agreement with the Programme Committee composed of representatives of the 
Member States and Associated States, considered that many good proposals 
would be excluded if the callâ€™s indicative budget of 70 million euro  was 
maintained, it increased the budget for this call to 140 million euro. 
12.	The project proposals were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary panel of 
62 
independent experts according to four criteria:
-	European added value;
-	scientific and technological excellence; 
-	relevance to the objectives of the scheme; and 
-	quality of the management. 
13.	Seventy-seven projects were judged as being of an appropriate 
standard 
and thirty projects received financial support, with 92 million euro 
being 
awarded for 19 Design Studies and 48 million euro for nine CNI projects . 
Research facilities can also be co-financed by the Structural Funds 
14.	In addition to funding from the research budget managed by the 
Commission, under the various Framework Programmes, the development of 
research facilities can also be financed through the EUâ€™s Structural 
Funds 
which are financed by the EU budget but managed by Member States. As a 
source of potential funding, the 3 billion euro available under the 
â€Research, 
Technological Development and Innovation (RTDI) Infrastructureâ€ area of 
the 
Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period was significantly greater than 
the 
715 million euro allocated for research infrastructures under FP6. Figure 
3 
presents the amounts involved and the maximum co-financing rates relevant 
to 
the various sources of funding.

Some changes in the Commissionâ€™s approach for FP7
15.	The 7th Framework Programme (FP7)  (2007-2013), introduces some 
changes in the area of Research Infrastructures in comparison to FP6. The 
approach adopted for the DS scheme has generally remained unchanged but 
changes have been made to the CNI scheme in the area of project selection 
and a shift of funding emphasis from the construction to the preparatory 
phase.
16.	For project selection,the FP7 approach is more â€œtop-downâ€ and the 
projects 
selected for support are mainly those included in the â€œEuropean roadmap 
for 
new research infrastructuresâ€. This is a list prepared by the European 
Strategy 
Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). 
17.	ESFRI is a forum which seeks to provide a coherent approach to 
research 
policy-making in Europe and is composed of appointees of the Ministers 
responsible for research in the Member States and Associated States and a 
Commission representative. The â€œRoadmapâ€ sets out the scientific needs in 
the 
area of research infrastructures in Europe for a 10-20 year period and 
identifies 
projects considered as being vital to the development of science and 
innovation 
in Europe. 
AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH
18.	 The purpose of the audit was to assess the CNI and DS funding 
schemes 
and their contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the RI 
activity 
during the FP6 period (2002-2006).
19.	The audit approached this through the following questions:
(a)	Did the Design Studies scheme result in feasibility studies and 
preparatory 
work which were useful to decision makers in the creation of new research 
infrastructures?
(b)	Did the CNI scheme effectively catalyse the construction of new 
infrastructures?
(c)	Did the Commission take action to promote the use of complementary 
funding, as included in the FP6 decision, within the DS and CNI schemes?
20.	The audit involved:
-	an analysis of the legal basis of the RI area and specifically the 
establishment of the DS and CNI schemes;
-	a review of the project selection and monitoring procedures 
(including all 
relevant evaluation reports);
-	interviews with staff of the Commission and with representatives of 
the 
principal European research organisations and of research ministries in 
eight 
Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom);
-	on-the-spot audits of a sample of nine of 19 Design Studies and all 
nine CNI 
projects; and
-	an on-line survey of all unsuccessful applicants.
The audited period was that of FP6 (2002 to 2006). The audited projects 
are 
listed in Annex I and II.
OBSERVATIONS
The Design Studies scheme 
Objectives mainly achieved
21.	The objective of the Design Studies scheme was to contribute to 
feasibility 
studies and technical preparatory work for new infrastructures with a 
clear 
European dimension. The scheme was judged by the Court as being 
successful if:
-	EU funding facilitated studies which led, in the medium-to-long term, 
to the 
enhancement of a fabric of research facilities of a European dimension 
and;
-	the co-financed studies exhibited European added value.
22.	Following the various audit interviews carried out, the Court noted 
that 
participants generally had a positive view of the Design Studies scheme 
and 
thought that the existence of a â€˜Design studyâ€™ resulted in an increased 
level of 
awareness and support on the part of national decision-makers. A majority 
of 
the projects were subsequently included in the ESFRI list (see paragraphs 
16 
and 17), increasing the likelihood of construction (see Figure 4). 



Figure 4 - Development of the nine DS projects audited by the Court
 
23.	During interviews, project coordinators and Member Statesâ€™ 
representatives 
also stated that Community support for Design Studies had been of 
importance 
in bridging the gap between the elaboration of an idea and the actual 
implementation of a project. The support had given scientists an 
opportunity to 
demonstrate and work out their proposals in a structured way. Most 
project 
coordinators were also of the opinion that the possibility for a number 
of 
institutions to collaborate together in joint undertakings was a valuable 
and 
worthwhile aspect of this support scheme. Textbox 3 contains an example 
of 
cooperation between major European research institutions who otherwise 
would have been competitors.
Textbox 3 - the EUROFEL project 
The EUROFEL Design Study was a joint effort on the part of 16 European 
research 
institutions to prepare for the construction of the next-generation of 
free-electron laser 
light sources, to be built as a distributed infrastructure in seven 
European centres. 
Originally, there were seven different, competing projects for 
constructing free electron 
lasers in five European countries. However the Commission advised the 
individual 
institutions to submit a joint proposal thereby enhancing European 
collaboration in the 
area. For some participants, the main benefit of the project was the 
collaboration of 
different institutions, which would normally be competing against each 
other.
The success of the Design Study can be gauged from the inclusion of the 
construction 
project in the â€˜European Roadmap for Research Infrastructuresâ€™ and is 
scheduled to be 
constructed in the next eight to 12 years.

24.	Beneficiaries and the representatives of research organisations 
stated that, 
in terms of securing funding, the design phase of an infrastructure 
project is the 
most difficult one. This is especially the case when international co-
operation is 
necessary. The DS scheme, with a financial involvement of the Commission 
of 
up to 50 % of total cost, was therefore considered by interviewees as 
being 
important in that it provided a framework for the development of large-
scale 
European projects. The interviewees thought that pan-European 
collaboration 
is difficult to set-up through mechanisms with a more national or 
regional 
programme emphasis.
The Construction of New Infrastructures (CNI) scheme
The catalysing effect and European added value
25.	The criteria for the payment of EU funds under the Construction of 
New 
Infrastructures (CNI) scheme are insufficiently specific. Council 
Decision 
2002/835/EC  stipulates that the scheme was to provide the minimum 
funding 
necessary â€˜to catalyseâ€™ the activity, with most of the construction and 
operational costs assured by national or other sources of finance. A 
catalyst is 
something that accelerates or promotes a reaction or process. In the 
Courtâ€™s 
understanding, this implies that the payment of CNI funding should result 
in 
projects going ahead which would otherwise not have been undertaken. 
26.	Decision 2002/835/EC goes on to say that funding should be provided 
on 
the basis of a detailed justification â€˜based on European added valueâ€™. 
The 
Commissionâ€™s 2002-2003 work programme for FP6, interprets the CNI 
eligibility 
requirement to say that CNI support will be available â€˜where such support 
could 
have a critical catalysing effect in terms of European added valueâ€™. This 
could 
be demonstrated, as mentioned in the work programme, in terms of an 
improved attractiveness for, and/or improved services to, the research 
community in Europe, by way of: 
-	a wider accessibility of the proposed infrastructure, 
-	a more advanced technology, 
-	a more flexible adaptability to interdisciplinary studies, 
-	a better connectivity to the research community.
27.	The Court examined all  CNI projects and considered how the 
Commission 
had applied the above mentioned eligibility requirements set out in 
Decision 
2002/835/EC and elaborated on in the Commissionâ€™s 2002-2003 work 
programme.
28.	In the important matter of the access of European researchers to 
infrastructures, the Court found that Commission financing focused on the 
funding of the construction or the purchase of equipment without 
sufficiently 
securing access for researchers. 
Little â€˜catalysing effectâ€™â€¦
29.	In order to assess whether Construction of New Infrastructures (CNI) 
support had a â€˜catalysing effectâ€™ the Court examined:
-	the relationship between the starting date of projects and the date 
when 
contracts with the EU were signed, which would indicate the importance of 
the funding to the undertaking of the project;
-	whether the decision to grant or refuse funding for projects was 
determinant 
for the project going ahead or continuing; and
-	perceptions of the main stakeholders regarding the extent to which EU 
investment served as a catalyst for other investment in projects.
30.	The Courtâ€™s audit found that seven of the nine CNI projects had 
starting 
dates in advance of the relevant Commission decisions and subsequent 
signing of contracts. (see Figure 5). An eighth project started after the 
Commission decision but before the contract had been signed.
Figure 5 - Timeline of project start and contract signature
 
31.	As in most cases the projects were up-and-running before contracts 
were 
signed and as Community support for CNI projects was limited to a maximum 
of 10 % of the total project cost , there was no evidence that EU-funding 
was a 
determining factor in the decision as to whether projects went ahead or 
not 
(see example in Textbox 4).
Textbox 4 - Phase 1 of the DIRAC project
The aim of the construction of the International Accelerator Facility at 
the Darmstadt 
Ion Research and Antiproton Centre (DIRAC) in Darmstadt is to up-grade 
the existing 
accelerators for future research on the origin of the universe. This 
project, to be co-
financed by 14 partners (11 EU Member States, China, India and Russia), 
includes 
both new infrastructure (magnet) and upgrades of existing infrastructure 
(synchrotron 
accelerator and spectrometer). 
EU funding amounting to 10,4 million euro was intended to support the 
first phase of 
the project, which was estimated at 104 million euro. The total 
investment is expected 
to be in the region of 1,2 billion euro. When the contract with the 
Commission was 
signed, the project was already under way. 

32.	During interviews, the representatives of European research 
organisations 
and Member Statesâ€™ ministries, stated that the CNI scheme did not 
â€œcatalyseâ€ 
the activities for which support was granted because of the low level of 
funding 
available and the fact that, by definition, the provision of only 10 % of 
total 
project cost, is insufficient for the production of a catalysing effect.
33.	A similar observation was made in the Evaluation Panel Report: â€œ(â€¦) 
the 
experts felt that EC funding was having a higher impact for Design 
Studies 
compared to Construction projects since the construction would happen 
anyway and the benefit of the 10 % help from the EU was sometimes not 
very 
clear.â€ .
34.	In replying to the audit survey, nine out of ten responding non-
successful 
applicants confirmed that the Commissionâ€™s decision on funding did not 
have a 
substantial influence on the realisation of projects and most of the 
applicants 
continued with their projects despite having been rejected, although 
sometimes 
with a reduction in scope (see Figure 6).
35.	When a similar question was put by the Court to the coordinators of 
successful CNI projects, three out of four replied that a negative 
decision of the 
Commission would not have prevented their projects from going ahead (see 
Figure 6 also).

â€¦but CNI support resulted in the purchase of additional or better 
equipment
36.	Although EU funding, adding 10 % on top of project costs agreed at a 
national level, had little â€˜catalysing effectâ€™ so far as projects as a 
whole were 
concerned, it enabled the purchase or development of additional equipment 
not 
foreseen in the initial project proposal. This funding therefore 
complemented 
national funding and in this sense, EU funding allowed the 
infrastructures to 
have more or better technology. In some cases it also facilitated the 
interdisciplinary use of facilities. 
Complementarity of funding
The Commission advocated complementary funding but took only limited 
action
37.	As already mentioned in paragraph 14, in addition to funding 
infrastructures 
through the research budget, Community support can also come from the 
Structural Funds in support of regional and cohesion policies. The EIB 
may 
also finance research infrastructure projects which have a European 
dimension. 
38.	Double financing or submitting the same item of expenditure for 
support 
from different schemes is prohibited. The co-financing of a project from 
different 
EU financing mechanisms is rarely possible due to the specific rules on 
co-
financing for each instrument. The complementary use of funding sources 
is 
however allowed. Complementarity of funding means using different sources 
of 
funding for different project activities, which are carried out in a 
related or 
consecutive manner . 
39.	The possibility of using complementary funding from different 
European 
sources has been advocated in various Community documents. In its report 
of 
May 2000 , the European Parliament strongly encouraged the complementary 
use of funding under the Framework Research Programme and other 
Community policies, in particular the Structural Funds. The Commissionâ€™s 
Communication â€œTowards a European Research Areaâ€  announced that, in the 
area of research infrastructures, the potential to combine Structural 
Funds, EIB 
loans and FP6 funding should be exploited.
40.	The use of complementary funding in respect of the DS and CNI schemes 
was also treated in the decisions establishing FP6  and the specific 
programme â€˜Structuring the European Research Areaâ€™ . Design studies were 
to be undertaken on the basis of a systematic exploration of â€œthe 
possibilities of 
contributions from other sources, including the EIB or the Structural 
Funds for 
the funding of these infrastructuresâ€. Support from the CNI scheme â€œmay 
supplement contributions from the EIB or the Structural Funds for the 
funding of 
these infrastructuresâ€. The use of complementary funding was also 
mentioned 
in the Research Infrastructures Work Programme . 
41.	Combining the use of structural, cohesion and other funding sources, 
with 
research funding, is specifically intended to realise the potential of 
the EUâ€™s 
convergence regions in terms of industrial and research development.
42.	Despite advocating the use of complementary sources of funding in the 
Decisions and documents mentioned above, the issue was not actively 
addressed by the Commission during FP6. There was no guidance material 
established to help project coordinators search for potential funding 
synergies 
and indeed no CNI projects benefited from either Structural Funds 
financing or 
EIB loans during the period. Most of the unsuccessful applicants surveyed 
stated that they had not been informed about the possibility of using 
complementary funding sources (see Figure 7). 
Figure 7 - Information on complementarity of funding â€“ results from the 
ECA 
survey of unsuccessful applicants

 
43.	There would also be a need for practical steps to be taken by the 
Commission to adequately administer the complementarity aspect e.g. 
checks 
for double financing or ineligible co-financing. However it was noted 
that:
(i)	the relevant DGs ( RTD and REGIO ) did not establish a common 
definition of a â€œResearch Infrastructureâ€,
(ii)	the two DGs did not have the means of cross-linking information on 
projects eligible for both FP6 and Structural Funds, and
(iii)	under Cohesion policy, no specific tools and databases to manage 
and 
coordinate the complementarity of funding have been developed. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
44.	 The Court considered the DS scheme to have mainly met its objectives 
whereas the CNI scheme was judged to have provided low added value.
Was the DS scheme a useful tool for decision makers?
45.	Representatives of the research community were generally positive 
about 
the Design Studies scheme. They thought that it provided an opportunity 
for 
scientific ideas to be developed in a structured way by testing the 
feasibility of 
potential future research facilities. The possibility provided for 
different 
institutions to collaborate together was particularly welcomed. The 
process 
helped decision makers identify which projects were worthy of support and 
the 
majority of the DS projects audited were included on the ESFRI list.
Did the CNI scheme catalyse the construction of new infrastructures?
46.	Funding through the CNI scheme did not have a determining effect on 
project implementation. Payment of CNI assistance made possible some 
technical upgrading of the investment projects concerned, with the 
acquisition 
of new or better equipment. However the CNI scheme did not result in the 
construction of new infrastructures but rather provided additional 
financing to 
projects which would have gone ahead irrespective of the existence of the 
scheme.

Recommendation 1
The Commission should reconsider whether in future Framework Programmes, 
CNI projects should be funded from the research budget given the Courtâ€™s 
findings concerning the European added value and catalysing effect. 
The Commission should ensure that scheme objectives are stated in terms 
that 
are clear and understandable to all and should be realistic given the 
intended 
level of project funding involved.  
Did the Commission take action on complementary funding?
47.	Despite including in the FP6 decision, the possibility of funding DS 
and CNI 
projects from complementary EU budgetary sources, the Commission did not 
actively promote this possibility and consequently it was not used.
Recommendation 2
The Commission should clarify what it intends to achieve by including in 
the 
legislation the possible complementary use of funds. It should consider 
the 
advantages and disadvantages of such funding and the associated costs and 
benefits. If it believes that useful synergies can be achieved through 
combining 
earmarked EU funds, EIB loans and national financing, it should actively 
promote the use of complementary funding sources, whilst ensuring that 
adequate controls are put in place to prevent and detect any misuse of 
this 
option.
